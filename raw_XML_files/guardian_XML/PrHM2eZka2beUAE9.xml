    <p>The Milan owner, <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref>, could be close to selling 75% of his shares in the seven-times European Cup winners after reportedly holding talks with Chinese investors over a potential €1bn takeover.</p>

    <p>Lee was pictured alongside Berlusconi at a game in October, fuelling rumours that he could be about to purchase a share of the club. The deal is expected to include Berlusconi’s daughter, Barbara, continuing in her position as a club director.</p>
    <p>Italian news agency AskaNews believes that the Chinese government is playing an instrumental role in the takeover in a bid to promote football in the country.</p>
    <p>Berlusconi took over <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan">Milan</ref> in 1986 and has seen the club win five European Cups under his stewardship.</p>
