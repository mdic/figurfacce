    <p>The Milan owner and Italian prime minster <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref> has described the massive wages being paid to footballers as unacceptable in the current economic climate and called for a salary cap.</p>
    <p>"Footballers' salaries are outside reality. It is necessary to introduce a salary cap," Berlusconi was reported as saying by the ANSA news agency today.</p>
    <p>"They are unacceptable, distant from the real economy in which we live in a difficult time like this. They are outside every parameter."</p>
    <p>Berlusconi also denied speculation he intended to sell part of his stake in the <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/football/serieafootball">Serie A</ref> club.</p>
