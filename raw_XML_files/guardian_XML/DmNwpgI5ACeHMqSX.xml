    <p>Italy's judges and prosecutors are to go on strike in protest at a proposed reform of the legal system by Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right government which one of their leaders said yesterday "laid the basis for an attempt to 'fascistify' the judiciary".</p>
    <p>Winding up a conference of Italy's national magistrates association, its general secretary, Carlo Fucci, said a bill being debated by parliament was reminiscent of one passed at the start of Benito Mussolini's dictatorship, which put the courts at the service of the regime. A strike was needed to defend the independence of Italy's judiciary, which was "in serious danger". No dates have been set for the action.</p>
    <p>The head of Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia party, Sandro Bondi, said Mr Fucci's speech merely proved his party's allegations that Italy suffered from a politicised judiciary.</p>
    <p>The proposed law advocates limiting the independence of individual prosecutors and making them subject to a structure that critics say would be easier for the government to control.</p>
