    <p>Silvio Berlusconi has been found guilty of tax fraud and sentenced to four years in prison for tax evasion.</p>
    <p>The <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan">Milan</ref> owner has also been banned from holding public office for three years in a case involving the acquisition of film and television rights on behalf of Mediaset, the broadcaster he controls. The former Italian prime minister, who has denied wrongdoing, is expected to appeal.</p>
    <p>Berlusconi was accused of buying US film rights at inflated prices via offshore companies. Prosecutors alleged part of the money declared for the purchase of film rights was skimmed off to create illegal slush funds, reducing Mediaset's tax liabilities.</p>
    <p>Over the past 15 years, Berlusconi has faced criminal investigations, indictments and trials on charges ranging from false accounting to corruption. He has always denied the charges. In some cases, he was acquitted at trial. In others, he either wasn't charged, or the charges were dropped because the statute of limitations on the alleged crimes expired.</p>
