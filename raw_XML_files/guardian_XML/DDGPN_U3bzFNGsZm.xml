    <p>Jeremy Paxman's probing <ref target="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2634220/Did-call-Angela-Merkel-lard-Extraordinary-moment-Silvio-Berlusconi-quizzed-gaffes-Jeremy-Paxman.html">interview with Silvio Berlusconi</ref> may have garnered plenty of headlines, but <hi rend="#b">Newsnight</hi> had a narrow escape after a bungle in the emailed transcript of the exchanges sent under embargo to journalists. In the broadcast interview, Berlusconi said that comic and activist <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/beppe-grillo">Beppe Grillo</ref> "has many things in common with Robespierre, Stalin and Pol Pot, so he is not someone to be taken lightly." However, in the transcript sent out to press it said he "has many things in common with Robespierre, Stalin and Hitler". Cue an "urgent correction" email from what Monkey assumes was a frantic Newsnight PR team. Perhaps whoever transcribed the interview had the Nazi dictator on their minds after <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/may/21/prince-charles-reported-to-have-likened-putin-to-hitler">Prince Charles reportedly compared Vladimir Putin</ref> with Hitler. Still, as the old news adage goes 'never wrong for long'.</p>
