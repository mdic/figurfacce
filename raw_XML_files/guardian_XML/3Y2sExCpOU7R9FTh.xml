    <p>European leaders have thrashed out the latest in a series of deals designed to convince the financial markets that the single currency is safe and its members are creditworthy. But, after a fraught week in Brussels, there remains plenty to sort out.</p>
    <p>In the studio, <hi rend="#b">Martin Kettle</hi>, <hi rend="#b">Rafael Behr</hi> and <hi rend="#b">Anne Perkins</hi> examine the details of a plan that could effectively use Germany's economy as collateral for the debts of southern Europe. What this means for the politics of the EU remains to be seen.</p>
    <p>Also this week: after a petition was signed by more than 100,000 people in Britain calling for a referendum on continued EU membership, the motion was defeated in parliament. But 81 Conservative members rebelled against their whips, creating a major party management problem for <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron">David Cameron</ref>.</p>
    <p><hi rend="#b">Philip Cowley</hi>, the professor of politics at Nottingham University, says that this is already the most rebellious group of MPs since 1945 â€“ and history shows that rebellions increase over the cycle of a parliament.</p>
