    <p>Italy's interior minister has defended plans to allow citizen patrols amid outrage over a new rightwing guard with fascist-like symbols on its uniforms. The Italian National Guard was launched on Saturday amid outcry that its logo, an imperial eagle and black-rayed sun, evoked Italy's fascist-era paramilitary blackshirts. Founder Gaetano Saya denies being a fascist, but has denounced plans by Milan prosecutors to investigate alleged violations of a law that makes it a crime to apologise for fascism. The interior minister, Roberto Maroni, said citizen groups were necessary and would be regulated. <hi rend="#b">AP </hi><hi rend="#b">Rome</hi></p>
