    <p>Italian prosecutors have demanded a five-year prison sentence for the former prime minister <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref> in his trial on corruption charges.</p>
    <p>The prosecutor Fabio De Pasquale has urged the court to find Berlusconi guilty of having paid a British lawyer $600,000 (Â£382,000) to lie in other trials involving charges of tax evasion and false accounting related to the billionaire media mogul's business dealings.</p>
    <p>The court is racing towards a verdict before the charges expire under Italy's statute of limitations. De Pasquale calculated that would happen by mid-July.</p>
    <p>The case is one of several pending against Berlusconi in the Milan courts, including a trial on charges of having paid for sex with an underage prostitute.</p>
    <p>Berlusconi stepped down as prime minister in November after failing to persuade investors he could revive the ailing economy.</p>
