    <p>In five months, some 30 women were procured for parties given by Italy's prime minister, <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref>, according to a statement to police by the businessman who supplied them. Extracts published today in the newspaper Corriere della Sera identified by name at least half a dozen women who stayed the night at Berlusconi's Rome residence.</p>
    <p>The businessman, Gianpaolo Tarantini, said his aim was to win favours from those in power. "I wanted to get to know prime minister Berlusconi and to that end I incurred significant expense to enter into his confidence," he was quoted as saying. "Knowing of his interest in the female sex, what I did was to take girls to see him, introducing them as friends of mine and concealing from him that sometimes I paid them."</p>
    <p>The standard rate for staying on at Palazzo Grazioli, Berlusconi's residence in the centre of Rome, was €1,000. Otherwise, the women were merely paid expenses.</p>
    <p>Tarantini said Berlusconi had provided him with an introduction to the head of Italy's civil protection department, which places orders for equipment worth millions of euros each year. The civil protection boss passed him on to a private firm with which he held talks. "But then nothing more happened," he said.</p>
    <p>The statement also came as an embarrassment for the opposition. Tarantini, who is under investigation in the southern city of Bari on suspicion of providing drugs and aiding and abetting prostitution, claimed to have furnished glamorous bed-mates for a former centre-left deputy regional governor.</p>
    <p>He also said he had organised a campaign dinner for an ex-prime minister, Massimo D'Alema. But there was nothing in the statement, dated 29 July, to suggest any wrongdoing by D'Alema.</p>
    <p>The parties for Berlusconi took place between last September and January this year. Tarantini appears to have begun well-prepared.</p>
    <p>"When I accompanied the girls to Palazzo Grazioli I made them sit on the rear seats because the windows in the back of my vehicle were darkened, I having had them replaced in, if I'm not mistaken, September 2008," he told police.</p>
    <p>The women ranged from high-class prostitutes to a television showgirl known to the viewing public. But Tarantini's statement implies that demarcation lines were blurred. One woman was described as "a very dear friend" to whom he supplied cocaine at parties. "She is not in principle a professional sex worker," Tarantini was quoted as saying. "But, if need be, she doesn't have a problem with being paid for sexual services."</p>
    <p>Several of the women were foreigners – a key point because of opposition claims that Berlusconi's sex life could have compromised national security. Tarantini claims that at least some of the prime minister's security officials were aware of what was going on.</p>
    <p>Berlusconi's office did not immediately comment on the claims.</p>
