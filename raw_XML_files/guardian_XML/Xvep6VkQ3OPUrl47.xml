    <p>Free glossy magazine with every copy of the Daily Telegraph today! Well, not entirely, it just looks like it, such is the size of the gigantic picture of the "topless model" who became a "glamorous minister" in Silvio Berlusconi's cabinet, <hi rend="#b">Mara Carfagna</hi>, on today's Telegraph front page. "Miss Carfagna, 33, is a former glamour model whose sultry looks and portfolio of lingerie shoots earned her the title of 'world's hottest politician' from the men's magazine, Maxim," pants the paper. And from readers of the Telegraph too, no doubt. Phwoar!</p>
