    <p>Anna Wintour shed her usual froideur during an interview in La Repubblica newspaper.</p>
    <p>"I have no other words. I am disgusted and embarrassed," she said.</p>
    <p>"How can Italy tolerate <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref> and his bevy of girls?"</p>
    <p>She described the prime minister's government as "in effect a dictatorship" and contrasted the respected standing of Italian fashion to the way in which Italy's political life has been dragged into disrepute.</p>
    <p>She also said she would like to see demonstrations by women against Berlusconi during the fashion shows in Milan.</p>
