    <p>I love a happy finish, so, for me, the G8 summit conclude in right way - although I cannot deny there were some awkward early moments.</p>
    <p>Take the first night, when I suggest wives run along to drawing room after dinner so we men can discuss important affairs and inconsequential flings. "And that mean you, too," I say, patting Frau Merkel on her backside. "We keep your husband, though - he going to help me watch a special movie about equalities."</p>
    <p>To the gentlemen, I twinkle: "Can I get you anything? Coffee? Cigar? The one on Italian Big Brother 5 who did it in the Jacuzzi? Or I got a couple of pretend lesbians, including one with a darker suntan even than yours, Barack ..." But they have run out of the door. I understand: probably they wish to take advantage of my programme of in-room entertainment. By the wives' side of the bed I put a file marked "Your guide to enjoying the summit". It include such things as moaning about my aid budget, or my Aids budget or something, and changing their outfits often so one of my newspapers can call them ugly. The husbands' file looks the same on the outside, but inside is selection of dirty jokes and invitations to assignations with the one off Italian Wheel Of Fortune who made sex tape in her dressing room.</p>
    <p>But now? Well, now that it is all over, I regret missed opportunities for serious action. Perhaps it is time to pick up phone. "Carla," I breathe into receiver, "why you got to still play hard to get with me?"</p>
