    <p>Silvio Berlusconi today denounced as "media trash" a rapidly growing controversy over his links with a 17 year-old Moroccan girl.</p>
    <p>Three close associates of the Italian prime minister were earlier reported to have been made suspects in an investigation into the alleged aiding and abetting of juvenile prostitution.</p>
    <p>One of the three, a nationally famous television newscaster, Emilio Fede, said he was unaware of being under investigation, but said he had met the girl at the centre of the affair at Berlusconi's home.</p>
    <p>According to the daily <ref target="http://www.repubblica.it/">La Repubblica</ref>, the girl – known as "Ruby" – was released from a police station in Milan in May, following a direct intervention by the prime minister's office.</p>
    <p>She had been detained on suspicion of theft, but was allowed to go after the police were apparently told that she was the niece of the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak.</p>
    <p>Questioned at a press conference today, Berlusconi said: "I am a person with a heart, and so I take an interest in people's problems. But I do not take an interest in media trash."</p>
    <p>La Repubblica said Ruby was met outside the police station by the second reported suspect, Berlusconi's former dental hygienist, an ex-showgirl called Nicole Minetti, who was elected this year as a regional MP for the prime minister's party.</p>
    <p>The third alleged suspect is Dario "Lele" Mora, a showbusiness manager and talent scout who is claimed to have taken "Ruby" – a runaway – under his wing when she arrived in Milan.</p>
    <p>Mora said he had "nothing to say" about the reports. The news agency AGI quoted "Ruby" as saying her version of events had been "manipulated".</p>
    <p>According to La Repubblica, she told investigators she had attended three social events at Berlusconi's villa outside Milan, but had never had sexual relations with him. She had been taken to the first – a Valentine's Day party – in an official car with a police escort and, when she arrived, she found that Fede and the then 73-year-old Berlusconi were the only men among some 20 women.</p>
    <p>The paper quoted her as saying a second party had ended in an erotic game known to those present as "bunga bunga". According to different newspaper accounts, Ruby claimed to have received ¤30,000 or ¤150,000 from the prime minister.</p>
    <p>An opposition spokesman called for Berlusconi to make a statement to parliament.</p>
