    <p>Demonstrators from L'Aquila clashed with police today as they tried to get close to Silvio Berlusconi's office to demand more state help to rebuild their lives in the wake of the earthquake in April 2009 that killed more than 300 people.</p>
    <p>The protest by about 5,000 people paralysed central Rome. It was a blow for Berlusconi, who has presented his hands-on response to the earthquake as one of the main successes of his government.</p>
    <p>At least one person was injured as police in riot gear tried to control the crowd, which was later allowed to get closer to the prime minister's office.</p>
    <p>Residents of L'Aquila want the government to extend tax exemptions for the victims.</p>
    <p>Berlusconi often boasts on television that new houses in the devastated city were built in record time. But residents say that after an initial flurry of headline-grabbing initiatives reconstruction, money ran out and many people have been left to fend for themselves.</p>
    <p>"Only a few people were given new homes," said one protester. "The rest of us are still in the same situation. There are no projects to rebuild the historic centre. L'Aquila is a dead city and we have been forgotten."</p>
