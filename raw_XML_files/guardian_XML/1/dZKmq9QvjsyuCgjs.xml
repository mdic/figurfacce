    <p>Mills's activities come under increasingly close scrutiny by Italian prosecutors investigating one of his clients, <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref>. Mills had set up offshore companies and trusts for the Italian prime minister's business empire, which prosecutors try to show had been used to dodge tax and convey under-the-counter payments to politicians. Prosecutors initially treat Mills as a prosecution witness.</p>
