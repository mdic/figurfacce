    <p> The Italian prime minister was so anxious to finish a conversation on his mobile phone yesterday that he waved away Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, as she waited to greet him at the start of the <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/nato">Nato</ref> summit.</p>
    <p> At Buckingham Palace last Thursday, the Queen expressed irritation with the Italian leader as he posed for the group photograph at end of the <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/g20">G20</ref> summit. "What is it? Why does he have to shout?" she asked as Berlusconi called out to Barack Obama, who was standing behind her at the time.</p>
