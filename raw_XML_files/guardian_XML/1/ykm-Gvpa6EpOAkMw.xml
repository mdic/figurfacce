    <p>The Italian government is erasing the basic principles of democracy, ignoring all opposition and diminishing the importance of a whole country demonstrating against Berlusconi and his ministers. Students are protesting, parents with their children, university researchers, professors and directors. We live in a state where a brave writer like Roberto Saviano can't walk around safely because our government allows the mafia to be stronger than it is (Letters, October 22). We live in a country where the government ignores its commitments to <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</ref> for the environment. Well, everywhere south of Naples is probably a lot worse than the east European countries now.
