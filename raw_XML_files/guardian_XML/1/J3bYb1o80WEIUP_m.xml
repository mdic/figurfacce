    <p>The former Italian prime minister <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref> has been ordered to pay his former wife €1.4m (£1m) a month in alimony as part of a divorce settlement, Italian media reported.</p>
    <p>Veronica Lario, 58, was married to the billionaire media magnate and politician for nearly 25 years before divorcing him in 2014. She was initially awarded an allowance of €3m a month.</p>
    <p>Berlusconi, 78, appealed against the amount and a court in Monza, near Milan, ruled on Tuesday that he would have to pay her €1.4m.</p>
    <p>The two separated in 2009 after Berlusconi was embroiled in a scandal over his participation in the birthday party of 18-year-old Noemi Letizia. Lario told the press that she “could not stay with a man who associates with minors”.</p>
    <p>In 2011, Berlusconi was accused of paying exotic dancer Karima El-Mahroug for sex when she was underage at “bunga bunga” parties at his villa in Milan. He was convicted in 2013 but was cleared this year.</p>
