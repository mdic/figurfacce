    <p>Italy's powerful trade unions voiced outrage on Thursday at pledges given by the prime minister, <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref>, to the EU, but held back from calling a general strike.</p>
    <p>Responding to pressure from the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and French president, <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-sarkozy">Nicolas Sarkozy</ref>, Berlusconi promised to make it easier for firms in economic difficulty to reduce workforces. In a letter to Brussels before Wednesday's summit, he said his government would approve the legislation by May next year.</p>
    <p>Berlusconi's chief ally, Umberto Bossi, implied that the finance minister, Giulio Tremonti, had refused to endorse the letter, which included a €15bn (£13bn) programme of asset sales and an undertaking to raise the standard retirement age to 67. "Tremonti slipped away," Bossi said.</p>
    <p>The finance minister has imposed strict discipline on Italy's public finances. But he has come under fire for failing to find ways to encourage growth in the economy – badly needed if Italy is to meet its targets for reducing its budget deficit and €1.8tn public borrowings. The IMF forecast last month that Italy's GDP would rise by only 0.3% next year, a full percentage point lower than it predicted in June. From Brussels, the European commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, said it was "imperative for Italy to firm up [its] commitments and do so with a clear timetable".</p>
    <p>Berlusconi heads one of the most rightwing governments in Europe. But he has repeatedly avoided neo-liberal reforms, apparently daunted by the political cost of taking on Italy's many vested interests. These include the unions, increasingly criticised in recent years for protecting members – mostly older workers with "jobs for life" – while ignoring the army of younger Italians on temporary contracts. The proposed labour market reform would scarcely affect them.</p>
    <p>Raffaele Bonanni, the general secretary of the moderate, Catholic-inspired CISL labour federation called the letter "an incitement to revolt". He added that if the law were changed without the approval of the unions "the CISL will go on strike".</p>
    <p>Susanna Camusso, head of the left-wing CGIL, Italy's biggest trade union federation, said Berlusconi had committed the government to a "nightmarish measure", but refrained from spelling out how her organisation intended reacting. The metalworkers' leader, Maurizio Landini, whose union has often taken a more radical stance than the CGIL, came closest to proposing a nationwide stoppage when he said that "faced with solutions of that sort, a general mobilisation of the country is needed". In an effort to defuse the situation, Berlusconi's employment minister, Maurizio Sacconi, swiftly offered talks "without prejudice" between the government, employers and unions. As if to forestall backsliding by Rome, the statement issued at the end of the summit called on the commission to assess Italy's pledges and "monitor their implementation".</p>
