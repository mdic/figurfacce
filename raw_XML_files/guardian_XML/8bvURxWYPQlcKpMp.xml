    <p>The euro isn't Europe's only slithering, seeping problem: try basic press freedoms as well. Try the <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/21/silvio-berlusconi-telephone-bugging-law">draft law due for debate in Italy's Senate this week</ref>. No more reporting of criminal investigations before they come to trial (even if that takes years). No more recording or photographing of anyone, even a Mafia boss, unless that person approves. Only members of the state-approved "National Order of Journalists" allowed to film or record. Fines approaching half-a-million euros for publishers who transgress, with â‚¬20,000 per reporter also on the table.</p>
    <p>It's a malign insult to anything you can call press freedom in a half-functioning democracy. Some fly-blown old Third World dictatorship called Berlusconia, perhaps: but this is Europe, our Europe.</p>
