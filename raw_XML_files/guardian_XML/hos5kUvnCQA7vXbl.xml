    <p>Mediaset, the Italian broadcaster controlled by the country's former prime minister <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref>, has posted a 36% drop in profits.</p>
    <p>Its 2011 net profit fell to €225m (£188m) as advertising at its channels in Italy and <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/spain">Spain</ref> continued a downward trend amid a harsh economic climate. Its revenue fell by 1%.</p>
    <p>The company also warned that it expected net profit to be even lower for 2012, unless the ad market is boosted by the European football championships and the London Olympics.</p>
    <p>While Mediaset's free-to-air channels are suffering shrinking audiences, Mediaset Premium, which competes with Rupert Murdoch's Sky Italia paybox, ended the year with revenue up 14% to £515m.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Berlusconi's personal income rose 20% in 2011 to £40m.</p>
