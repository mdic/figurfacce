    <p>Anglo-Italian former dental hygienist who treated Berlusconi on the night he was attacked with a statuette of Milan's cathedral in 2009. Had recently become a regional councillor for his party when she fetched Mahroug from a police station in 2010.

    <p>Dubbed Ilda the Red by some, the formidable prosecutor who has led the case against Berlusconi is known for her confrontation of the powerful, including mafia gangsters. Since taking on this case, she has received threatening letters and bullets in the post. A magazine owned by the Berlusconi family has published photographs of her with less than flattering captions.</p>
