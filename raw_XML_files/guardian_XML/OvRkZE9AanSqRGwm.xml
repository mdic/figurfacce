    <p>Silvio Berlusconi has had a hair transplant, the doctor who performed the operation confirmed yesterday, adding that the Italian prime minister will win the battle against baldness</p>
    <p>After days of speculation sparked by the white bandanna worn by Mr Berlusconi on holiday in Sardinia, Piero Rosati said the results of the operation would show in a couple of months.</p>
    <p>"Yes, it was me," he told the Corriere della Sera daily, a day after denying the rumour to another newspaper.</p>
    <p>"Nobody can do miracles ... but there will definitely be an improvement," Dr Rosati said, adding that the first hairs should appear "in a month or two".</p>
