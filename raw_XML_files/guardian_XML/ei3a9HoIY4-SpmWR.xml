    <p>There will be blood. A decision by the <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/european-commission">European Commission</ref> two days ago has given <hi rend="#b">Rupert Murdoch</hi> the edge in his ongoing war with Italy's own media mogul - and prime minister - <hi rend="#b">Silvio Berlusconi</hi>.</p>
    <p>The EU ruled that Murdoch's <hi rend="#b">Sky Italia</hi> could bid for one of the terrestrial-based spectrums that is used to broadcast up to eight free-to-air TV channels.</p>
    <p>This decision, which overturned a 2003 restriction on Sky Italia, threatens the dominance of Italian television by Berlusconi's <hi rend="#b">Mediaset</hi>. There will be an appeal, of course. La lotta continua.</p>
