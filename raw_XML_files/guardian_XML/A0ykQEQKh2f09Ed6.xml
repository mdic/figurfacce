    <p>Is it just us or does Silvio Berlusconi's hair look uncannily like Playmobil? Not that we're suggesting it's fake, or was stuck on by a child. We're not implying that the Italian prime minister is just 3in tall, or is for sale in toy shops or anywhere else. But that hair is suspiciously neat, isn't it? Does it come off?</p>
