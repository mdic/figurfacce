    <p>Milan's owner, <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref>, believes Mario Balotelli's off-field behaviour will prevent him from putting on the <hi rend="#i">Rossoneri</hi> shirt in the future.</p>
    <p>The <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity">Manchester City</ref> striker has made headlines both on and off the pitch since joining the club from Internazionale last summer.</p>
    <p>Berlusconi told Gazzetta dello Sport: "There is a <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan">Milan</ref> style of behaviour that I don't think is very close to that of Balotelli. Every now and then, he has a bit of a distraction. I don't think his style suits us."</p>
    <p>The 20-year-old Balotelli grew up a fan of Milan and has been linked with the club. He was dropped from the Italy squad last month for breaking the national team's code of conduct after being sent off for a bad challenge during Manchester City's Europa League match against Dynamo Kyiv.</p>
