    <p>The car belonging to one of the women who gave evidence to investigators about Silvio Berlusconi's alleged bunga-bunga sessions was set alight at the weekend. Nadia Macri, who claims to have twice had sex with Italy's 74-year-old prime minister, said: "I really don't think that the prime minister has anything to do with my car."</p>
    <p>She told reporters she had recently received a number of menacing text messages that she had shown to police after the discovery of the burnt-out car. Berlusconi's lawyers have strenuously denied Macri's allegations and contest her claim that the prime minister's dinners at his house outside Milan led on to orgiastic sessions in a room equipped for pole-dancing.</p>
    <p>Another female guest at parties given by Berlusconi had her car set alight in June 2009. Barbara Montereale, a model, was among the witnesses in an investigation into the activities of a businessman who admitted recruiting dozens of women for dinners at the prime minister's residence in Rome.</p>
    <p>The fire occurred after she gave a press interview in which she said that, after one of the dinners she had attended, Berlusconi slept with another guest, who was a prostitute.</p>
