    <p>The European parliament ended its furious row with <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref> last night after the Italian prime minister was forced to express "regret" for suggesting a German MEP should star in a film about concentration camps.</p>
    <p>The Forza Italia leader admitted to Pat Cox, the Irish president of the assembly, that "in the course of an animated debate certain expressions and comparisons may have hurt the sensitivities of MEPs and may have been misunderstood".</p>
    <p>"In no way had he ever intended to offend," an agreed statement said.</p>
    <p>The terse kiss-and-make-up text was negotiated by Mr Cox to defuse fury over Mr Berlusconi's attack last week on Martin Schultz, a German socialist.</p>
    <p>Mr Schultz had criticised the conflict of interest between the prime minister's political position and his vast media empire.</p>
    <p>MEPs insisted that Mr Berlusconi's expression of regret to the German chancellor, Gerhard Schr¿der, was not enough, so Mr Cox was mandated to agree "an act of clarification".</p>
    <p>But even as the deal was being finalised, <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy">Italy</ref> was forced on to the defensive once more after comments by a junior minister led Mr Schr¿der to threaten to cancel his summer holiday in Italy.</p>
