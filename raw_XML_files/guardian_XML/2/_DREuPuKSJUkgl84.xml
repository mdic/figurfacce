    <p>‚ÄúItaly looks to have taken a step to the right and moved towards populism and change.</p>
    <p>The complexity of the Italian voting system makes it very difficult to establish what happens next and when, but neither of the anti-establishment Five star movement or League parties are an attractive option for markets or the euro.‚Äù<lb/> Shares in Silvio Berlusconi‚Äôs Mediaset company have fallen by over 4% after his Forza Italia party did worse than expected in Sunday‚Äôs election, lagging behind the Northern League. Mediaset has been fighting a long legal battle with France‚Äôs Vivendi, and a strong showing by Forza Italia would have strengthened its hand.</p>

    <p>The Italian election results have prompted a fall on the euro. It hit a six-month low versus against the yen after stronger than expected results for results euro-sceptic parties, Reuters reports.</p>
    <quote>
      <p>The euro zone‚Äôs third biggest economy now faces a prolonged period of political instability after voters delivered a hung parliament, spurning traditional parties and flocking to anti-establishment and far-right groups in record numbers.</p>
      <p>The euro fell 0.3% and was traded at $1.2282, edging towards its seven-week low of $1.21545, which it touched on Thursday. Against the yen it fell to 129.35 yen, its lowest level since late August.</p>
      <p>Although no party won a majority, the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement came out as a clear winner, looking set to become the largest single party by a wide margin.</p>
      <p>The centre-right bloc, made up of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi‚Äôs Forza Italia, and the far-right League and Brothers of Italy, is set to win most seats but is seen falling some way short of an absolute majority.</p>
      <p>But in a bitter personal defeat for the billionaire media magnate, his Forza Italia party was overtaken by its ally, the far-right, anti-immigrant League.</p>
      <p>Investors are likely to take fright at any suggestion the 5-Star could form a coalition with the right-wing League.</p>
      <p>Initial tallies suggested the two forces would have enough seats to govern together and they have in the past shared strong anti-euro views. While the League still says it wants to leave the single currency at the earliest feasible moment, the 5-Star says the time for quitting the euro has passed.</p>
      <p>‚Äú(The euro) gained in early Asian trade, perhaps due to the German vote, but then started turning down as the results from Italy began coming in. I‚Äôd expect it to weaken further today as the market absorbs the results of the Italian election,‚Äù said Marshall Gittler, chief strategist at ACLS Global.</p>

    <p>This was an anti-establishment triumph on a par with Brexit and Trump, according to Bloomberg and Reppublica columnist Ferdinando Guigliano.</p>
    <p>He shares his thoughts over a large moka.</p>

    <quote><p>2. Let's start with the electoral arithmetics. It's ugly. None of the three blocs (Centre-right, Centre-left, 5 Star Movement) will be able to secure a majority. We will need some form of grand coalition, which, in a way is what we always expected.</p>‚Äî Ferdinando Giugliano (@FerdiGiugliano)<ref>March 5, 2018</ref></quote>
    <quote><p>4. These calculations should not distract us from the main political message of</p>‚Äî Ferdinando Giugliano (@FerdiGiugliano)<ref>#ItalyElection2018</ref>- this was an anti-establishment triumph, of the same league as the<ref>#Brexit</ref>or the<ref>#Trump</ref>upsets, in the eurozone's 3rd largest country.<ref>March 5, 2018</ref></quote>
    <quote><p>5. More than half of the voters have backed the Five Star Movement and the League. These parties have been very cautious (to say the least) on the euro, critical of Italy's migration policy, and open to "no vax" ideas.</p>‚Äî Ferdinando Giugliano (@FerdiGiugliano)<ref>March 5, 2018</ref></quote>
    <quote><p>7. This new political reality will not go away by calling a new election or by some coalition wizardry.The 5 Star Movement has been excluded from power for years, but has kept growing.The League is in a dominant position in the centre-right. Like it or not, this is the new Italy.</p>‚Äî Ferdinando Giugliano (@FerdiGiugliano)<ref>March 5, 2018</ref></quote>
    <quote><p>8. The League and the 5 Star Movement will be rightly celebrating today. But the hard part starts now. They have triumphed on a fanciful platform of unrealistic promises (flat tax, universal basic income). If they go into government, they are bound to disappoint.</p>‚Äî Ferdinando Giugliano (@FerdiGiugliano)<ref>March 5, 2018</ref></quote>
    <quote><p>9. What happens when reality starts to bite? Will anti-establishment parties turn against the EU, or will they renege on their promises because leaving the euro is too dangerous? It's far too early to tell, but I guess we are about to find out.</p>‚Äî Ferdinando Giugliano (@FerdiGiugliano)<ref>#Italianelections2018</ref><ref>March 5, 2018</ref></quote>
