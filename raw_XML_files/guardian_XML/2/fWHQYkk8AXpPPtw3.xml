    <p>Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, in effect let himself off one of the most serious criminal charges against him, according to documents lodged with a Milan court.</p>
    <p>In September, a court acquitted him of falsifying the accounts of his business to cover up a €10m (£7m) illegal donation to the party of the late prime minister Bettino Craxi.</p>
    <p>In a delayed ruling, the judges said Mr Berlusconi and three former bosses of his Fininvest firm could not be convicted because what they had done was no longer a crime, following a law change after Mr Berlusconi came to power in 2001.</p>
