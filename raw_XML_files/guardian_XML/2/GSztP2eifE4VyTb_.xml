    <p>Italian Prime Minister <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref> insists the use of 'drastic measures' could be the only way to crack down on violence inside Italian football stadia.</p>
    <p>Berlusconi, who also owns AC Milan, revealed his plans to take action after his team's Champions League derby against Internazionale was abandoned last night at the San Siro.</p>
    <p>Angry Inter supporters rained missiles down on the pitch, while Milan goalkeeper Dida was struck on the shoulder by a flare as the teams were led off the field, before the game was abandoned.</p>
    <p>Having met his Interior Minister Giuseppe Pisanu, Berlusconi's office issued a statement which read: "There is a clear risk of even more serious incidents in future, a risk which must be avoided by all possible means.</p>
    <p>"Premier Berlusconi urged the interior minister to maintain the firm line that has been taken for some time, with particular reference to preventative measures. However, resorting to the most drastic measures available should not be ruled out if necessary."</p>
    <p>Last night's scenes were the latest in a series of high-profile incidents in Italian football and only recently Pisanu warned that some matches may have to be played behind closed doors.</p>
