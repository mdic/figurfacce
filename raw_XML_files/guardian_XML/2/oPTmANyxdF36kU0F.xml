    <p>Silvio Berlusconi was last night facing demands for a reality television show on one of his channels to be scrapped after it provoked viewer outrage and a threat of an advertising boycott.</p>
    <p>A young woman's breast enlargement operation was featured on Scalpel - Nobody's Perfect, a programme in which viewers volunteer for cosmetic surgery. It is shown on Italia 1, owned by Mr Berlusconi, who himself underwent a facelift recently.</p>
    <p>Religious and parents' groups lodged protests and threats of legal action. The food firms Nestl√© and Ferrero were among advertisers saying they were withdrawing support from the show.</p>
    <p>The producers said there had been calls for the show to be longer, adding: "It would be a mistake to pretend cosmetic surgery did not exist."</p>
