    <p>The Italian prime minister, <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref>, begins one of the most difficult weeks of his political career today, trying to bring his allies back on board to save his coalition government.</p>
    <p>He is being urged to call a general election because of the withdrawal of the third party in the coalition, the Union of Christian Democrats, in the fourth year of his five-year term.</p>
    <p>The UDC was alarmed by the scale of the coalition's defeat in regional elections earlier this month and Mr Berlusconi's diminishing popularity, and had demanded an immediate change in policy.</p>
    <p>La Stampa said Mr Berlusconi was on the telephone most of the weekend trying to restore the coalition.</p>
    <p>He had at least one conversation with the UDC leader, Marco Follini, previously one of his two deputy prime ministers, trying to find a way forward. The paper said the conversation was "chilly".</p>
    <p>Mr Berlusconi is due to meet President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi to explain how he intends to resolve the crisis.</p>
    <p>There is expected to be at least a cabinet reshuffle.</p>
    <p>Constitutionally, if he cannot reach a settlement he must hand in his resignation to Mr Ciampi and a general election will be held within 70 days.</p>
