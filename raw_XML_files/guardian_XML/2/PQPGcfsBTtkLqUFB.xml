    <p>The Italian prime minister, <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref>, was today in court on bribery charges in what was expected to be his final trial appearance before parliament approves an immunity bill protecting him from prosecution.</p>
    <p>Mr Berlusconi, who is the first serving Italian prime minister to stand trial, told a packed Milan courtroom that there was no evidence against him.</p>
    <p>He is accused of bribing judges in 1985, before he was a politician, to block the agreed sale of SME, a state-owned foods conglomerate, to rival tycoon Carlo de Benedetti.</p>
    <p>It is alleged that Mr Berlusconi, wanting SME for himself, arranged for Â£85,000 to be paid to two judges, Filippo Verde and Renato Squillante, who overruled the sale to Mr de Benedetti.</p>
    <p>The prime minister denies the claim, saying that he is the victim of a political plot by Milan-based centre-left magistrates.</p>
    <p>"I wonder how the money of Italian citizens can be spent setting up a trial that is based exclusively on inventions," Mr Berlusconi told the court during his hour-long appearance.</p>
    <p>"There isn't - I repeat, I want to say this strongly - a piece of evidence, an accusation, a document. And there is no motive," he said.</p>
    <p>The prime minister said that, because of the trial, "tons of mud have been thrown at me for seven years by newspapers, television, in <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy">Italy</ref> and abroad".</p>
    <p>As the billionaire businessman turned politician left the courtroom, some booed him, while others starting chanting his name, shouting "up with Silvio" and clapping their hands.</p>
    <p>To the frustration of prosecutors and judges, today was only the third time that Mr Berusconi has attended court since the proceedings began three years ago.</p>
    <p>His appearance comes a day before the lower house of parliament is expected to pass an immunity bill, barring the country's top five officials from prosecution.</p>
    <p>The move would suspend his corruption trial indefinitely, just before Italy takes over the EU presidency on July 1.</p>
    <p>Mr Berlusconi, whose current term ends in 2006, insists that an immunity law would safeguard the democratic will of those who elected him from the unfounded charges of left-wing magistrates.</p>
    <p>However, opponents have called the bill a "monstrous, unconstitutional mistake", and accused him of using his power to protect himself and his private interests.</p>
    <p>The Milan prosecutor, Ilda Boccassini, has presented her case against Mr Berlusconi, but has not yet made a formal request for a prison term.</p>
    <p>In another trial dealing with the same case, Ms Boccassini has asked for a conviction and 11-year sentence against Mr Berlusconi's ally, the former defence minister Cesare Previti.</p>
    <p>The two trials were originally held together, but the court separated them because the premier's work schedule continually halted the proceedings.</p>
    <p>Mr Previti, who denies the charges, was convicted in a similar bribery trial last month, and sentenced to 11 years in prison. He has launched an appeal.</p>
