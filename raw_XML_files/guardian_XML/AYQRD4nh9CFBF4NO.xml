    <p>A former Italian MP who allegedly acted as a mediator between the Cosa Nostra and <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref> before the ex-prime minister entered politics has denied fleeing the country to avoid arrest as a court in Sicily declared him a fugitive.</p>
    <p>Anti-mafia investigators said they had not been able to find Marcello Dell'Utri – a long-time Berlusconi ally who helped create the former premier's Forza Italia (FI) party in the 1990s – whom they were seeking to issue with an arrest warrant.</p>
    <p>Prosecutors said they had reason to believe the 72-year-old posed a flight risk ahead of a supreme court hearing next week which could see him definitively convicted of mafia association and sentenced to seven years in prison.</p>
    <p>But, after hours of speculation that he had fled to Lebanon, the Dominican Republic or the west African nation of Guinea-Bissau, Dell'Utri issued a statement saying he had left the country for a "period of treatment and rest" and was outraged by the "abhorrent" attempt to arrest him.</p>
    <p>However, nowhere in the comments, issued to the Italian news agency Ansa, was there any indication of where exactly Dell'Utri was.</p>
    <p>"I would like to clarify that I do not intend to back out of the result of the upcoming sentence of the court of cassation and that, as I am in a precarious state of health – for which, among other things, I underwent angioplasty several weeks ago – I am undergoing further examinations and tests," the former politician was quoted as saying.</p>
    <p>"I have learned of the abhorrent request for preventative detention while abroad for a period of treatment and rest," he added. "In any case, I wait with confidence for the result of the supreme court."</p>
    <p>Dell'Utri was in parliament, as a deputy, MEP and senator, from 1996 until 2008. He was found by the Palermo appeals court, which confirmed his conviction last year, of having carried out "mediation" between figures in the Cosa Nostra and Berlusconi in the 70s. This "pact of protection", wrote the judges in their reasoning, lasted until 1992, two years before the billionaire media tycoon was first elected prime minister.</p>
    <p>Dell'Utri has always denied any links with the mafia and any ties between it and Berlusconi. The former premier also denies any links.</p>
    <p>The old friends are both coming to crunch moments in long-running legal battles. The 77-year-old FI leader is due to soon find out how he will serve his commuted one-year sentence for tax fraud.</p>
    <p>On Thursday prosecutors argued for entrusting Berlusconi to <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2014/apr/10/silvio-berlusconis-judgment-day-you-choose-the-sentence">social services</ref>, making house arrest – a far less desirable outcome for him – unlikely.</p>
