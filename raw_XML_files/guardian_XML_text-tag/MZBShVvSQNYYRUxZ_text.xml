<p>The Italian prime minister, <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref> has made a court appearance in Milan in a tax fraud case. The two-hour hearing, held behind closed doors, dealt with technical matters during which Berlusconi said nothing. A decision on whether he will face prosecution will not be made until the end of May. His lawyer, who says Berlusconi will attend court only in so far as his prime ministerial schedule will permit, has said he has not yet decided whether he will attend next week's hearing for charges over alleged relations with an underage prostitute. He denies all charges.</p>
