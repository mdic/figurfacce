<p>Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's former prime minister, was scrambling to retain influence over the fractured landscape of the country's centre-right on Saturday, after the man who was once considered his political heir broke with him in a damaging personal and political snub.</p>
<p>At times appearing weak and tired, the 77-year-old billionaire told supporters at a party congress that he had not slept on Friday night following the "very painful" decision by his former loyalist Angelino Alfano to lead a breakaway group that would support Italy's fragile grand coalition government.</p>
<p>As Berlusconi formalised the rebirth of Forza Italia (FI) – the party named after a football chant with which he won his first election in 1994 – he said it was "very difficult" to envisage continued support for the prime minister, Enrico Letta's, grand coalition in the event of a vote to oust him from parliament later this month.</p>
<p>The leader of the now-defunct People of Freedom (PdL) party, who is likely to be ousted from the Italian parliament within weeks due to his conviction in August for tax fraud, accused the centre-left – of which Letta is a member – of wanting to "politically kill" him.</p>
<p>But the three-times prime minister, who was dealt a humiliating blow last month when he tried and failed to pull the plug on the government, acknowledged that he did not have the numbers to bring down the coalition.</p>
<p>In a markedly more conciliatory tone than some of his supporters, who yelled "traitors" from the back rows of the congress, Berlusconi appeared to hold out an olive branch to Alfano and his breakaway faction, the New Centre-Right, by instructing his MPs to avoid picking fights with the rebels.</p>
<p>"This group, even if it appears to be supporting the left, will have to necessarily be part of the centre-right coalition," he said. Speaking later, Alfano, deputy prime minister in the Letta government, said the NC had already received the support of 30 senators and 27 deputies.</p>
<p>On Friday night, he had formalised a split that had been anticipated since he led a parliamentary rebellion against Berlusconi's "hawks" in a government confidence vote.</p>
<p>A front-page article in the daily newspaper Corriere della Sera said the split had fundamentally altered the dynamics of the centre-right and raised many questions about its future.</p>
<p>"Where there was the People of Freedom there is now a 'ground zero', and who knows in what form the centre-right will be reborn, how much time it will take to rebuild it and who will assign themselves the new project," said the newspaper, adding it was equally unclear whether "the architect who for 20 years designed it in his own image still has the strength to create another".</p>
