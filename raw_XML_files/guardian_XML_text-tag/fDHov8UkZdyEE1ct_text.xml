<p>Italy's constitutional court has opened the way for <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref> to be put back on trial, throwing out crucial parts of the law that represented his latest attempt to shield himself from prosecution.</p>
<p>The 12-3 ruling complicates the Italian prime minister's efforts to consolidate his parliamentary majority and shortens the odds on an early election. Berlusconi faces returning to the dock in three interconnected prosecutions accusing him of fraud, bribery and other offences.</p>
<p>But according to some interpretations the complex judgment may give the prime minister plenty of scope to delay proceedings. One case concerns his alleged bribery of David Mills, estranged husband of the former British cabinet minister Tessa Jowell.</p>
<p>The law dealt with by the constitutional court was passed last year. It allowed for trials of cabinet ministers to be suspended on the grounds their official duties prevented them from defending themselves properly.</p>
<p>The court decided it is up to a trial judge to decide on a case-by-case basis whether this is a valid excuse.</p>
<p>Giovanni Guzzetta, a law professor at the Tor Vergata university in Rome, said: "The evaluation will, in the first instance, be a matter for the judge and, in the second, for the constitutional court if the defendant believes the judge's evaluation is amiss."</p>
<p>Donatella Ferranti, who heads the opposition group on the all-party justice committee in the lower house of Italy's parliament, said: "This is the umpteenth blow to a practice of making laws tailor-made [for Berlusconi] that has characterised this legislature. It confirms that the reasons for our opposition were well founded, reasonable and constructive."</p>
<p>But Berlusconi's culture minister, Sandro Bondi, said the court had given the judiciary a pre-eminent position, above the institutions of democracy. It represented "the overthrow of the principles not just of our constitution but of the fundamental principles of any democracy".</p>
<p>A leading parliamentary representative of Berlusconi's Freedom People movement, Osvaldo Napoli, said: "Pontius Pilate would have been more daring in giving his judgment."</p>
<p>The court's ruling had been sought by judges in Milan, the city in which Berlusconi's business interests are headquartered and in which he faces the trials, all of which will now have to begin again. The biggest risk comes from one in which he is accused of bribing Mills, his former offshore legal adviser, to give false testimony.</p>
<p>The British lawyer was convicted of taking the bribe. Although his conviction was quashed last year by Italy's highest appeals court, it was on the grounds that the charges against him were timed out by a statute of limitations.</p>
<p>On Wednesday Berlusconi dismissed the accusations and repeated his familiar argument that he is a victim of politically motivated judges. He said he was "indifferent" to today's outcome and it would not affect the government.</p>
<p>But after scraping through a no-confidence vote in December he needs to lure more MPS to his side, and can only do so if he can persuade them that he and his government are strong enough to survive.</p>
