<p>Silvio Berlusconi has landed himself at the centre of a new storm by ridiculing the Italian judiciary, less than two months after comparing a German MEP to a concentration camp guard.</p>
<p>Asked by the British weekly the Spectator about the trial of his predecessor Giuliano Andreotti, who was cleared this year of Mafia connections, Mr Berlusconi - himself repeatedly tried on corruption and other charges - appears to have erupted.</p>
<p>"These judges are mad twice over!" it quoted him saying. "First, because they are politically that way, and second because they are mad anyway. To do that job you need to be mentally disturbed. You need psychic disturbances. If they do that job, it is because they are anthropologically different."</p>
<p>Carlo Fucci of the National Magistrates' Association said: "It is unthinkable that a prime minister could say such things about the members of an institution in the country he governs."</p>
<p>A spokesman for Mr Berlusconi's party, Forza Italia, said the prime minister "doesn't give a damn about political correctness".</p>
