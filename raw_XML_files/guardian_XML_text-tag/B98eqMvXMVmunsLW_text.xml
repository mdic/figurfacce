<head rend="h2">And the award for best awards ceremony goes to …</head>
<p>The Oscars season got an unofficial starting pistol this weekend, with two major awards ceremonies dominating the cinema headlines. Saturday was the turn for Tallinn to enjoy the limelight, as the European Film Awards travelled to Estonia and <ref target="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/dec/05/roman-polanski-film-ghost-writer">awarded a rather remarkable number of trophies</ref> to Roman Polanski's The Ghost.</p>
<p>Sunday was the London's turn, as the British Independent Film awards <ref target="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/dec/05/kings-speech-british-independent-film-awards?intcmp=239">bowed down before The King's Speech</ref>. <ref target="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2010/dec/06/alternative-british-film-awards-2010">Charles Gant wrote us his alternative awards</ref>; and the podcast – <ref target="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/audio/2010/dec/09/film-weekly-david-lynch-music">as well as featuring an interview with David Lynch on how he went pop</ref> – brought us a Bifas special, featuring chat with award winner Rob Lemkin.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, over at the <ref target="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/gallery/2010/dec/06/weekend-in-film-awards?intcmp=239#/?picture=369411081&amp;index=11">Marrakech film festival</ref>, there was a golden star for Catherine Deneuve, a lifetime achievement award for Francis Ford Coppola and a whole lotta love for John Malkovich.</p>
