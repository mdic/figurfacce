<p>Any lingering hopes Chelsea misfit Andriy Shevchenko may have been nurturing of returning to the scene of his greatest glories seem to have been shattered today after AC Milan president <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref> insisted the striker would not be going back to the San Siro.</p>
<p>Shevchenko ended a gilded seven-year stay in <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan">Milan</ref> last May when the <hi rend="#i">Rossonieri</hi> reluctantly agreed to sell him to Chelsea for Â£30.8m, but he has failed to ignite since his arrival in England and has been rumoured to be looking for a way back to Italy. Milan seemed the most likely destination, both because of the success he enjoyed there and because of his friendship with Berlusconi, but the former Italy prime minister today sniffed: "It's an issue that is behind us, it's a closed argument."</p>
<p>Shevchenko has mustered just three goals in 14 Premiership appearances and generally looked off the pace. Last week he was quoted as saying Chelsea's style of play does not suit him, though he subsequently denied making any such comment.</p>
