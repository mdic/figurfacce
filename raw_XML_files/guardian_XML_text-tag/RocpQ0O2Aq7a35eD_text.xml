<p>Silvio Berlusconi has positioned himself as a benevolent statesman acting in the best interests of Italy as he reiterated his call for a grand coalition government with his opponents to break the political deadlock after last month's election.</p>
<p>As he emerged on Friday from a meeting with President Giorgio Napolitano, the head of state who has led a series of day closed-doors consultations with the parties, Berlusconi said there was "no other solution" than a broad coalition government that included his own centre-right Freedom People (PdL) party.</p>
<p>Touting it as a government of "professionalism and responsibility as well as common sense", the three-time prime minister said his rightwing alliance with the regionalist Northern League would accept Pier Luigi Bersani, the centre-left Democratic party (PD) leader, as premier.</p>
<p>But a technocrat or "quasi-technocrat" government was unacceptable, Berlusconi said, "given the negative and tragic experience" of the one led by <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/mario-monti">Mario Monti</ref>, which is still in charge in a caretaker capacity and marks 500 days in office this weekend.</p>
<p>Berlusconi, 76, has been advocating the formation of a PD-PdL government since the paralysingly inconclusive election results nearly five weeks ago. Bersani, whose party has an outright majority in one house of parliament but not in the other, has consistently rejected it, not least because of the billionaire media mogul's desire to exert influence over the selection of Napolitano's successor as head of state.</p>
<p>On Friday, even after the embattled PD head admitted to Napolitano on Thursday that he had not been able to find the numbers for a government, the party's stance appeared no different.</p>
<p>The anti-establishment <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/five-star-movement">Five Star Movement</ref> of former comedian Beppe Grillo, meanwhile, maintained its resolute opposition to giving its support to any government.</p>
<p>Such was the continuing deadlock that Napolitano, whom some had expected to announce a new name to try to form a government, was said to be taking more time to reflect on the impasse. A statement was expected</p>
<p>One scenario would be a so-called "government of the president", led by a well-known but less political figure, which would have a relatively short term and a restricted remit of reform.</p>
<p>If neither that nor a broad coalition can be agreed on, Monti's mandate as caretaker prime minister could theoretically be extended.</p>
<p>Napolitano is keen to avoid a quick return to the polls â€“ which could, theoretically, happen as soon as June.</p>
<p>Berlusconi's PdL, meanwhile, is outperforming the PD in some recent polls, while attention in the PD is shifting to the mayor of Florence, Matteo Renzi. An SWG survey published on Friday found 66% of Italians would like to see Renzi leading the centre-left in a new election.</p>
