<p>Silvio Berusconi's defence lawyer says he is planning to appeal the ex-prime minister's seven year prison sentence for paying for sex with an underage girl. Niccolo Ghedini says the sentence is 'at odds with reality' and he is willing to take the appeal higher if necessary. The 76-year-old will not have to serve any of the sentence unless it is confirmed on appeal</p>
