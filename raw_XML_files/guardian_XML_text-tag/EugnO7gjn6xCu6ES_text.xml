<p>"And now, let the real bunga-bunga begin", a friend wrote on Facebook after <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref> was ordered to stand trial on charges relating to his so-called "bunga-bunga" sex parties. My friend detests Berlusconi, as many Italians do. But most responses to her comments were not so merciless. People wrote: "Let's keep calm, it's our chance to save Italy from all this insanity"; or "He'll be judged by three women, and it will be a rightful retaliation". The anti-Berlusconiani, as they are known, are now more serene than they used to be. The anti-Berlusconi women even more so.</p>
<p>Last Sunday, they proved to their country, to the rest of the world and – most importantly – to themselves, that they are no resigned Stepford wives, or Stepford escort girls. They showed they were capable of rebelling against the most misogynous culture in western Europe. They did it graciously and in huge numbers – one million, according to the organisers – gathering, along with many men, in more than 200 piazzas.</p>
<p>In Bologna, 50,000 women and men turned the demo into a party, marching in the streets and calling for the resignation of the PM. In Milan, 100,000 people flooded Piazza Castello. Many former Berlusconi voters were there. In Padua, a young Stieg Larsson fan held a sign reading "Lisbeth Salander, help us".</p>
<p>In Rome I lost my friends in the crowd, was hugged by schoolfriends of my daughter, worried about my 73-year-old mum with her terrible back pain standing among 200,000 people, met my beautician, my accountant, and, last but not least my favourite barman with his wife.</p>
<p>In Turin my ex-husband, who is deputy editor of the daily La Stampa, wrote: "I'm going to demonstrate against a prime minister accused of entertaining underage girls, against a culture that exploits women, against Italian men who make endless sexual jokes and brag about wasting lots of time looking at naked women on the web. In short, I'm going to demonstrate against myself, too." Many men did the same, and it gives us some hope.</p>
<p>But the demos offered no real alternatives. The pro-Berlusconi coalition is in a chaos. We don't have a united opposition, rather several parties, all uncertain about their political alliances for the next general elections that look more and more likely to be held this year. We Italian women may have had our finest hour on Sunday 13 February, but on Monday we were already complaining about the absence of a pragmatic agenda for a potential women's movement and the unreliability of our political class.</p>
<p>At least we have new role models. On Sunday we applauded women who are totally different from the young showgirls and the glamour-heavy ministers appointed by Berlusconi (themselves former showgirls) we had become used to. Women such as the leftwing trade union leader Susanna Camusso, the rightwing MP Flavia Perina, or Sister Eugenia Bonetti, a tough nun who drew cheers during her appearance in Rome.</p>
<p>And like all the ordinary women who came to the piazzas to say "enough is enough", they are bracing for a transition that could be dreadful. They have found their own voices after many appalling years. I hope they will continue to talk. Our county is in bad shape. We can't expect our confused, Berlusconised men to fix it. Not any more.</p>
