<p>Silvio Berlusconi was today quoted as saying his estranged wife, Veronica Lario, should apologise to him and not the other way around.</p>
<p>Italy's prime minister made his comment in a <ref target="http://www.corriere.it/politica/09_maggio_04/berlusconi_veronica_scuse_divorzio_veline_noemi_6ccc9956-3869-11de-a257-00144f02aabc.shtml">front-page interview with the editor of Corriere della Sera</ref>, the country's best-selling daily, on the day after <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/03/berlusconi-wife-divorce">his wife announced she was beginning divorce proceedings</ref>.</p>
<p>The interview appears to mark the launch of a vigorous counter-offensive by the Berlusconi camp, concerned that the shattering of his second marriage could have widespread political fallout.</p>
<p>The already distressed Berlusconi-Lario match headed for the rocks after the prime minister was reported to have attended the 18th birthday party of a Neapolitan girl who aspires to a career in showbusiness and calls him "Daddy". <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/01/veronica-lario-silvio-berlusconi-marriage">Writing to a news agency afterwards</ref>, Lario concentrated her fire on her husband's selection of a string of pretty young women to be candidates for his party in next month's European parliamentary elections.</p>
<p>"I am indignant," Berlusconi said. "Veronica has fallen into a trap. And I know who she is being advised by. Or rather, being incited by."</p>
<p>Asked if there was any chance of saving his marriage, the prime minister said: "I don't think so. I don't know if I want that this time. Veronica will have to apologise to me publicly. And I don't know if it would be enough.</p>
<p>"It's the third time in an election campaign that she has pulled a stunt of this kind. It really is too much."</p>
<p>Berlusconi said the affair was the result of "media criminality". The newspaper said he believed he was the victim of a plot to ruin him at the apex of his popularity.</p>
<p>According to other reports today, Berlusconi's aides fear his scorned wife could launch an all-out offensive against the prime minister in interviews with magazines and TV chat shows, revealing embarrassing secrets and sensitive information.</p>
<p>Berlusconi said he had dropped in on the birthday party of Noemi Letizia because her father, a council employee, was a "friend of many years". Asked why she called him <hi rend="#i">papi</hi>, he replied: "But it's a joke. They wanted to call me granddad. It's better they call me daddy, don't you think?"</p>
<p>The prime minister said three pretty young women whose candidacies were revoked after Lario's letter were not showgirls. One was an actress, he said.</p>
