<p>The Italian parliament last night gave final approval to a bill to overhaul the media, which critics have argued plays into the hands of media magnate and prime minister, <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref>.</p>
<p>The measure opens the way for the privatisation of the state broadcaster, RAI. Critics say it was drafted by Mr Berlusconi's government to advance the interests of his rival TV empire.</p>
<p>But his ministers maintain that the bill increases freedom of choice and provides the framework for an early introduction of multi-channel digital terrestial television.</p>
<p>After last night's vote in the Senate, the bill is due to go to the head of state, President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, to be signed into law. Opposition legislators have appealed to him to block the measure on the grounds that it is anti-constitutional.</p>
<p>The proposed new law overturns a ruling by the constitutional court that would have forced Mr Berlusconi to transfer one of his three free-to-air TV channels to satellite by the end of the month.</p>
<p>Apart from a bill passed this year granting the prime minister freedom from prosecution, the reform of the communications sector has been the most heatedly debated legislative proposal.</p>
