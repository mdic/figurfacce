<p>After three weeks refusing to accept that he had lost Italy's elections by a narrow margin, <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref> finally bowed to the inevitable yesterday and resigned as prime minister. The move paves the way for a new centre-left coalition government, led by Romano Prodi.</p>
<p>Mr Berlusconi was far from gracious in defeat. He is reported to have told a final cabinet meeting: "We will be missed. We will be remembered as the best government of the republic. Don't worry, Prodi won't have an easy task, he won't keep the left united, they are already divided, and we'll put up a strong opposition."</p>
<p>Mr Prodi will have to wait until he is given a mandate to govern by President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, who retires on May 18, or by Mr Ciampi's successor.</p>
