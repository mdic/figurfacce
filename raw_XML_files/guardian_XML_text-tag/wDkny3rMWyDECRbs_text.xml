<p>One of Italy's most successful and critically acclaimed film directors has hit out at a creeping climate of censorship in the country after he was refused funding for a dark satire about <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref>.</p>
<p>Marco Bellocchio, whose recent film Vincere has received rave reviews in the US, said that he was abandoning his next project, Italia Mia (My Italy), after 10 potential backers had run scared.</p>
<p>Describing the film as a study of power in today's Italy, Bellocchio told the daily Corriere della Sera his protagonist would be a young girl caught up in "well-known circumstances that have ended up in all the newspapers", climaxing at a "huge party at a luxurious island villa, maybe in Sardinia or Sicily, where shocking things happen".</p>
<p>In a week in which Silvio Berlusconi – famous for throwing wild parties at his Sardinian villa – was placed under investigation on suspicion of sleeping with an underage prostitute, Bellocchio said he would not be naming names, but the real-life inspirations for his characters would be obvious.</p>
<p>However, after receiving repeated refusals from producers, the veteran director said he is giving up. "No one, absolutely no one wants to produce my new film," he said, adding that the reasons given had been vague at best. "This has never happened in my career."</p>
<p>Making his name in 1965 with I Pugni in Tasca (Fists in Pocket), a study of a murderously dysfunctional family which presaged the intergenerational strife of the late 60s, Bellocchio has never shied away from controversy. L'Ora di Religione, his 2002 take on Vatican hypocrisy, stood out as one of the best Italian films of the last decade.</p>
<p>Vincere, his recent film about Benito Mussolini's cruelly mistreated first wife Ida Dalser, has been touted as Oscar material in the US. "In a normal country, all doors in the cinema world would open to a director like this," complained Corriere della Sera.</p>
<p>One successful Italian screenwriter blamed the Italian prime minister's stranglehold on the arts in Italy.</p>
<p>"Cinema cannot exist in Italy without funding from Berlusconi's own production house, from state broadcaster RAI which is indirectly controlled by Berlusconi, or in the form of subsidies from the Italian government," said Alessandro Bencivenni. "It is difficult to find a producer today who will invest in really risky projects."</p>
<p>Berlusconi's culture minister, Sandro Bondi, gave an idea of how his boss feels about satire when he <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/09/silvio-berlusconi-cannes-sandro-bondi">boycotted the Cannes film festival</ref> last year because it was showing the "unpatriotic" Draquila, a film by maverick comic Sabina Guzzanti accusing Berlusconi of seeking electoral profit from the Abruzzo earthquake.</p>
<p>Guzzanti's father, Paolo, a disaffected Berlusconi supporter who wrote about the prime minister's reign in his book Whoreocracy, said he had struggled to organise a book tour. "Local authorities did not want to lose their funding," he said. "What has happened to Bellocchio is a trend."</p>
<p>With a prime minister who wears shoelifts, undergoes facelifts, has faced accusations of shady business dealings and enjoys the company of very young women, Italy should be knee deep in satire.</p>
<p>But Guzzanti warned that political satire was on the wane, and censorship was not the only cause. "Voters on both sides of the Berlusconi issue are just tired and imitations of Berlusconi on TV just don't seem funny anymore."</p>
<p>Screenwriter Bencivenni said that mocking politicians had never had much traction with Italians. "There is a general understanding that politicians steal, so that is nothing new."</p>
<p>Italy's golden age of satirical films in the 1960s, often starring Alberto Sordi, had always poked fun at the vices of the common man, he said.</p>
<p>"What's new is that even that appears to be going out of fashion," said Bencivenni, who is part of the scriptwriting team behind a series of successful comedies released every Christmas in Italy.</p>
<p>"We are struggling to get people to laugh at immoral behaviour, possibly because that behaviour is so embedded in Italy today it doesn't look strange anymore."</p>
<p>Pupi Avati, a successful Italian director with screen credits to rival Bellocchio, agreed that many films mocking Italian vices now play to empty houses. "My film Il Figlio Piu Piccolo, a comedy about corruption, was not a success and I have sidelined a second project I had in the pipeline on a similar theme," he said.</p>
<p>"People now want to escape from reality and you have to make films which have a public."</p>
<p>Bellocchio said that he was not giving up hope and would keep his satire of Berlusconi's Italy ready if backers appeared. "I really believe in this project," he said. "Sooner or later I will film it."</p>
