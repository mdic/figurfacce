<p>Silvio Berlusconi goes back on trial today in the first of four upcoming court cases that will train an intense spotlight on his private life and business practices.</p>
<p>The prime minister is not expected to be present at the resumption of the trial in which he is accused of tax fraud. Among his fellow defendants, who also include several executives of his Mediaset television group, is the British lawyer <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/david-mills">David Mills</ref>, estranged husband of the former Labour minister Tessa Jowell.</p>
<p>The accused deny any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The trial, and another in which Berlusconi is a defendant, was suspended last year because of a law passed by the government providing the prime minister and others with immunity from prosecution while in office.</p>
<p>Key aspects of the law were overturned on 13 January, opening the way for the resumption of both cases.</p>
<p>In the second, which is due to resume on 11 March, he is accused of paying Mills a £373,000 bribe to withhold testimony. On Saturday, a judge will open committal proceedings in a third case in which Berlusconi and others, including his son, Pier Silvio, deputy chairman of Mediaset, are charged with fraud and embezzlement.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the prime minister was sent for trial in a fourth case involving his alleged payment of an underage sex worker and claims that he tried to cover up what he had done by abusing his position. That trial is due to start on 6 April, contributing the final element to a "perfect storm" of legal woe for the 74-year-old who denies all the accusations of wrongdoing levelled at him.</p>
<p>Never has Berlusconi looked more vulnerable. Often, in the past, he has avoided possible conviction owing to Italy's generous provisions for "timing out" offences, which one of his own governments made yet more liberal.</p>
<p>But there is no statute of limitations on juvenile prostitution offences, which have been put on to a fast track, look certain to run their course before the other charge is timed out. The position with regard to the other trials is less clear.</p>
<p>If the arguments of the prosecutor in the case that resumes this week are accepted, Berlusconi will have until 2014 to wrap up the trial and the two appeals allowed defendants under Italian law. But, according to some experts, the alleged offences could become subject to a statute of limitations as early as next year.</p>
<p>The Mills case is expected to be timed out 11 months from now. The British lawyer has already been convicted of taking the alleged bribe.</p>
<p>Last year Italy's highest appeals court quashed his conviction on the grounds that it was subject to a statute of limitations.</p>
<p>But two months later, giving the reasons for the ruling, the judges made it clear they believed a bribe had been paid.</p>
<p>Berlusconi's best hope of emerging from the storm unharmed may lie with parliament where his supporters are once again working on legislation that would allow him to spring free. A draft bill to be debated in the lower house in late March would cut the maximum duration of trials in a legal system notorious for its slowness.</p>
<p>Politically, the prime minister looks increasingly secure. Several politicians who had broken away with his former ally, Gianfranco Fini, have since announced they are returning to Berlusconi's party amid opposition claims that the prime minister is using his vast wealth to buy support. Last week, an opposition deputy claimed to have been offered €150,000 to join the other side.</p>
