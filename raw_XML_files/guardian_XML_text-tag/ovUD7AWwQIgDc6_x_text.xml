<p>The Milan president, <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref>, has confirmed that he will sell the seven-time European champions to Chinese investors and expects to receive €400m (£338m) over the next two years.</p>
<p>Berlusconi, who bought the club in 1986, has been <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/02/milan-silvio-berlusconi-milan-chinese-takeover">negotiating for more than a year</ref> with various interested parties but is now confident that a deal will now be completed after he was released from hospital on Tuesday after heart surgery.</p>
<p>“I had a period of 26 years which then became 30. My concern is that during the last four years, I have not managed to do things as I did in the past,” he said.</p>
<p>“The choice I am making is an important one. I want to deliver AC <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan">Milan</ref> to people who can make the club a major force again not only in Italy but in Europe and the world.</p>
<p>“There is a commitment from the new investors to pay €400m over the next two years and I’m selling the club to people who can bring it back to where it belongs.”</p>
<p>Milan, who reported a loss of €93.5m last year, <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/29/milan-vincenzo-montella-new-head-coach">appointed Vincenzo Montella</ref> as their new coach last week. They finished seventh in the league last season and will miss out on Europe for a third successive campaign.</p>
<p>Robin Li, the founder of search engine Baidu and rated as China’s sixth-richest man, is believed to be leading the consortium, which will purchase a 70% share in the club.</p>
<p>If completed, they will become the latest group of investors from China to buy a stake in a European club. In December, Manchester City’s holding company City Football Group<ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/01/manchester-city-265m-deal-chinese-investment-group"> announced a $400m (£265m) investment</ref> from a Chinese consortium, CMC, while property group Dalian Wanda bought a 20% stake in Champions League finalists Atlético Madrid last year.</p>
