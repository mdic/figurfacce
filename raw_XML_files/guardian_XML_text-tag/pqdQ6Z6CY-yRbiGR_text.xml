<p>Guardian commentators stress the risks to the euro and the EU itself of not accommodating a Greek default. That country’s flight from both euro and union, they say, would be fearfully dangerous for currency and institution. This is one-sided to the point of being one-eyed.

In the same deluded spirit, Aditya Chakrabortty (<ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/06/greece-euro-unanswerable-austerity-democracy">Opinion, 7 July</ref>) laments the 2011 appointment in Italy of an unelected technocrat, Mario Monti, and fears something similar in Greece.
