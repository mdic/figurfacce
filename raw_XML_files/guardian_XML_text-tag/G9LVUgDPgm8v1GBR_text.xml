<p>Italian police have arrested six people accused of trying to extort €35m (£28m) from <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref> in exchange for documents they claimed could help him in a legal case.</p>
<p>The Milan police squad chief, Alessandro Giuliano, said on Monday that three of the six had held one of the former prime minister's closest advisers hostage for 11 hours in his home last month until he reached Berlusconi by phone to demand the money.</p>
<p>Berlusconi's lawyer, Nicolo Ghedini, told reporters he spoke to the hostage-takers that day and refused to give them any money until he saw the documents.</p>
<p>Apparently that was all that was needed to free Berlusconi's treasurer, Giuseppe Spinelli.</p>
<p>Police later identified the ringleader by his red and black trainers – the colours of his favourite team, AC Milan, which Berlusconi owns.</p>
