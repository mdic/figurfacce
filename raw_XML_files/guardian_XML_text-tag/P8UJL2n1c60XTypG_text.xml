<p>Silvio Berlusconi's coalition partners warned the Italian prime minister yesterday they could bring down his government after Italy hands over the EU presidency next month, unless he moves to uphold their interests.</p>
<p>At a party rally in Milan yesterday, Umberto Bossi, reform minister and leader of the Northern League party, pushing for power to be devolved to the regions, warned that if his proposed reform package was not supported at a vote next month, "then it will be in our interest to close this legislature as quickly as possible. To begin a new one without treacherous allies."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at a meeting in the same city, the deputy prime minister, Gianfranco Fini, leader of the rightwing National Alliance party, urged reforms that would give his party as much influence as Mr Bossi's in the coalition. Mr Fini has clashed with Mr Bossi on several issues recently, including his proposal to give immigrants the vote.

But analysts warn he is heading for trouble over pension reform plans which triggered a general strike last month.</p>
