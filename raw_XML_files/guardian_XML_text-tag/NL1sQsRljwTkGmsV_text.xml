<p>Italy was firmly in the eye of the eurozone debt storm on Monday as it became the target of potentially self-fulfilling fears that it will be unable to pay off its <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jul/11/italian-bailout-fears-grow">huge public debts</ref>.</p>
<p>In an attempt to stem selling surges in the bond and equity markets, Italy's finance minister, Giulio Tremonti, promised to "send the markets a strong signal". He said a package of measures to reduce the budget deficit would be "armour-plated" and approved by parliament within a week: "Something that has never happened in the history of <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy">Italy</ref>."</p>
<p>The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said she had discussed the situation on Sunday with Italy's prime minister, <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref>. She told a press conference in Berlin that Italy had to agree "on a budget that meets the need for frugality and consolidation", adding: "I have full confidence the Italian government will pass exactly this kind of budget."</p>
<p>Concern over the effectiveness of the package was central to the sell-off of Italian shares and bonds that began on Friday. But neither Tremonti's nor Merkel's words managed to stem the panic. The yield on benchmark 10-year government bonds soared to 5.565% – the highest since May 2001 – which sharply increases the state's borrowing costs. At one point, the spread between the Italian benchmark bond and its German equivalent reached a record 290 basis points.</p>
<p>The concern over bonds infected the stock market where Italian banks, leading holders of their country's debt, were particularly badly hit. Intesa SanPaolo's shares lost more than 7.5% as the FTSE MIB index of Milan bourse blue-chips slid 3.9% by the close of business.</p>
<p>One of the concerns driving markets was that the return on Italy's bonds could reach a level that was unsustainable for its treasury. The rise in yields, in effect the interest rate Italy must pay to borrow, comes at a particularly awkward moment: Bloomberg estimated last week that between now and the end of 2012, the government will have to refinance 26% of its public debt.</p>
<p>The Italian state's accumulated borrowing has risen to almost 120% of GDP – the second highest level in the EU after Greece. As part of a programme for its reduction, Tremonti last week unveiled a four-year, €40bn-plus (£32bn) <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/05/italy-euro?INTCMP=SRCH">package of deficit-cutting measures</ref>.</p>
<p>But, with Berlusconi's coalition partners in the Northern League clamouring for tax cuts to buy back the government's lost popularity, all but €6bn of the adjustments were postponed. Fears that the package could be watered down – or that Tremonti may not be around to see them through – contributed to a growing sense of unease among investors.</p>
