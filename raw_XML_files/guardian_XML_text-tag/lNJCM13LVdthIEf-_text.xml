<p>Silvio Berlusconi has claimed Milan’s black striker Mario Balotelli has “taken too much sun”.</p>
<p>Berlusconi, who described Barack Obama as “tanned” in <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/06/italy-barackobama">2008</ref>, shortly after that year’s US presidential election, and again after the then Italian prime minister met the president in <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/28/obama-tan-berlusconi">2009</ref>, was discussing his wish for an all-Italian Milan team. The club’s owner then joked that the Italy forward Balotelli, “is also Italian even if he has taken too much sun”.</p>
<p>Berlusconi spoke at the Serie A’s club training ground during celebrations to mark his 30 years as owner. Balotelli was born in Sicily to Ghanaian immigrants and raised by Italian foster parents. He has suffered racist abuse throughout his career.</p>
<p>Balotelli, on loan from Liverpool, went to Anfield in 2014 after a season at <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan">Milan</ref>. Berlusconi says Milan could buy Balotelli back “if he wises up”.</p>
