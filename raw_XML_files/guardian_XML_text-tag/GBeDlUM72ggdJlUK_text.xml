<p>Italy's centre-left opposition yesterday reacted angrily to an attempt by Silvio Berlusconi's government to change the rules for the next general election, due in the spring.</p>
<p>A legislative amendment would reintroduce full proportional representation but with modifications opposition MPs said could mean the side with fewer votes emerges the winner. Polls show Mr Berlusconi's rightwing coalition trailing by 10 percentage points. The unofficial opposition leader, the former EU commission president Romano Prodi, said the proposals were "tantamount to robbery".</p>
