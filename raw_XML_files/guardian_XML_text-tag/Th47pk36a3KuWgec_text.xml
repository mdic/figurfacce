<p>Silvio Berlusconi's coalition made a surprisingly strong showing in regional elections across Italy, winning crucial races and snatching four areas from the opposition, final returns showed today.</p>
<p>Berlusconi emerged as the political victor after two days of balloting that had been largely depicted as a test of his popularity. His government ally, the Northern League, also fared well.</p>
<p>Overall, the conservatives won six regions – compared with the two they controlled going into the vote – while the centre-left opposition held on to seven.</p>
<p>The most resounding success for Berlusconi came overnight in two races that went down to the wire: Lazio, which includes the capital; and Piedmont, a region in the country's industrial north. Both were previously held by the opposition.</p>
<p>Around 64% of Italy's 41 million voters went to the polls – high compared with other EU countries, but 8% down on the last regional elections in 2005.</p>
<p>Analysts had predicted that a low turnout would hurt the governing power – as it did with President Nicolas Sarkozy in France's recent regional elections. But Berlusconi repeatedly urged his supporters to go to the polls ahead of the vote Sunday and yesterday.</p>
<p>In the last couple of weeks, the 73-year-old prime minister went on the offensive and stepped up his campaign through numerous media appearances and a big rally in Rome.</p>
<p>Almost two years into his current premiership, Berlusconi appeared vulnerable coming into the election, making his success all the more significant. His popularity has been falling as Italians grow concerned by job losses, frightened by the country's economic future and increasingly detached from a political class mired in corruption scandals.</p>
<p>The electoral campaign was dominated by judicial probes and legal wrangling over the list of his candidates, adding to a sentiment of disaffection toward politics.</p>
<p>"Nobody would have been surprised if Berlusconi had lost the regional elections," one of Italy's leading political analysts, Stefano Folli, wrote in the financial daily newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore.</p>
<p>"But Berlusconi manoeuvred with his usual dexterity through a mean electoral campaign," Folli wrote. "And he even managed to avoid the trap of a record-low turnout."</p>
<p>In Lazio, Renata Polverini, a largely unknown former rightwing union leader, defeated Emma Bonino, a veteran politician and former EU commissioner known for support for abortion and euthanasia rights that make her deeply unpopular at the Vatican. Bonino stepped into the race after the incumbent centre-left governor quit last year, amid a scandal involving cocaine and transsexual prostitutes.</p>
