<p>A prosecutor yesterday called for <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref> to be given an eight-year jail sentence as his four-year trial for allegedly bribing judges neared culmination.</p>
<p>Winding up the case for the state in the latest of the prime minister's several corruption trials, Ilda Boccassini told a Milan court room his business group Fininvest had had judges "on their payroll ... so that they served the interests of Berlusconi".</p>
<p>Her proposed sentence prompted an outraged reaction from the prime minister's supporters.</p>
<p>"This request is the death of justice," declared Sandro Bondi, national co-ordinator of Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia party.</p>
<p>In the Milan trial Mr Berlusconi is charged with giving money to his lawyer to bribe judges in Rome so as to secure the purchase of a state-owned food conglomerate.</p>
<p>The alleged offence took place several years before he entered politics.</p>
<p>A verdict is expected around the end of the year.</p>
