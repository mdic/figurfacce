<p>Silvio Berlusconi believes Milan would provide the perfect environment for Carlos Tevez to relaunch his career.</p>
<p>Milan have made several attempts to convince the Argentina striker to move to Italy and put an end to his ongoing dispute with <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchestercity">Manchester City</ref>.</p>
<p>Paris St-Germain have also been linked, but Berlusconi, Milan's owner and former Italian prime minister, has urged the 27-year-old to put footballing reasons at the top of his agenda as he seeks a new club.</p>
<p>"If he comes with us, he will win the Golden Ball award," Berlusconi told Gazzetta dello Sport. "Tevez has two options, one which regards prestige and the other one money.</p>
<p>"Milan is prestige and he would have the possibility to showcase his talent around the world and win the Golden Ball with us. PSG represents a strong economic force. He must choose between one or the other."</p>
<p>Milan's vice-president, Adriano Galliani, insisted on Wednesday that the club would not enter a bidding war with PSG. Juventus have also been linked with the estranged City striker.</p>
