<p>Some Italians rolled their eyes and cringed, others felt proud - and many were too familiar with their prime minister's sense of humour to react to Silvio Berlusconi's concentration camp "joke".</p>
<p>"As ever, Italy has embarrassed itself in front of the world. I am ashamed for Italy," said Anna, a 29-year-old architecture student out shopping near Rome's Spanish Steps. "He's an imbecile. But it's our fault. I didn't vote for him. But Italians did."</p>
<p>"Our prime minister is ignorant. He's a megalomaniac. He makes up for his ignorance by talking a lot. He should stick to running AC Milan. I hope someone will soon stop him trying to run Italy," added Christina, another student.</p>
<p>Further down the same street, opinion could not be more different: "The Germans think they own the world, not to mention Europe. Berlusconi put them in their place," said Davide Ferrucci, 49, a businessman.</p>
<p>"I was stunned," said Federica, 33, climbing on to her moped. "I'm Jewish and I feel very pleased that at last someone has reminded the Germans what they have done. It was perhaps not the ideal phrase he used. But it was just irony. I don't think the prime minister needs to apologise or even explain. If humanity has got over what the Germans did, I am sure the Germans can get over this."</p>
<p>"He tells this kind of joke every day in Italy," said security guard Luigi, 37. "It's nothing new for us, so it's hard to react any more. He didn't have to bring up the war, of all things. I wish he'd thought of a better joke. But I'm sure in a few days, they'll find a way to shake hands."</p>
