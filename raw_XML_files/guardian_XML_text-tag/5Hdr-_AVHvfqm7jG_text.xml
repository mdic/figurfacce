<p>I am naturally very disappointed by this verdict. I am innocent, but this is a highly political case. The judges have not yet given their reasons for their decision, so I cannot say how they dealt with the prosecutor's own admission that he had no proof. I am hopeful that the verdict and sentence will be set aside on appeal, and am told that I will have excellent grounds, and have every faith in my excellent lawyer, Federico Cecconi. The sentence does not become effective for any purpose until two levels of appeal have been concluded. I have been advised not to make any further public comment on the case until it has finally come to an end. Meanwhile I am getting on with my professional life.</p>
