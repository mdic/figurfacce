<p>I gather some people are becoming disillusioned with football – it's the sort of thing that's incessantly reported, the game's lost its head its heart its soul, its balls – but the rejection of the game, and it's perceived descent into the tactically unethical and the financially inconceivable, becomes their relationship with it. I've experienced it among my friends: "its all bollocks" they say, the players don't care, "there's too much money" – citing the example of Kaka and his potential £100m move.</p>
<p>I've always enjoyed the glamour of transfer sagas and the seedy mirth of decadent purchase. When Ruud Gullit was the most pricey player on the planet, I was titillated by the expense, his hair and his moustache. I imagined myself the guest of Berlusconi at an AC <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/football/acmilan">Milan</ref> dinner and dance, craning in to coach Arrigo Sacchi like a tipsy diplomat and complimenting him on his purchase like it were a giraffe from an Egyptian prince – "this Gullit gentleman is a dream – do you know where I could acquire one? In blonde?"</p>
<p>Even as we decry football we continue to bond with it through damnation. £100m for Kaka is a lot, but the time where reason could be applied to these figures has long expired – perhaps it was when Greavsie joined Spurs from Milan for ninety-nine thousand-nine-hundred and ninety-nine pounds that lunacy began to take hold. Applying such brinkmanship to avoid making Jimmy Greaves the world's first £100,000 player seems a bit obsessive – like Greavsie was petrol from a pump and they had to nervously trigger out the last few pennies in jittery spurts. The money in football has gone beyond arithmetic, I just see shapes; £100m, £200m, a trillion? Until deals are done in board members' vital organs, I will regard these figures as a meaningless hieroglyphic blur.</p>
<p>Mark Hughes, nominally Manchester City's manager, is keen to be seen as the puppeteer behind all this flamboyance – perhaps he should hurl his pancreas in with the bid, or a testicle, then his authority would be impossible to dispute. Must I, like John the Baptist, be the lone wailing voice shrilly observing that Kaka's name is Latin for whoopsie? Does that not affect his value? Does no one mind that it's not even his real name, so he has voluntarily affiliated himself with this infantile cuss?</p>
<p>His real name is Ricky, which is a cheeky, lovable handle which Kaka cast aside only to masquerade behind a childish expletive. He could've had any nickname but he stuck with Kaka. Naturally he had to choose one, evidently they are mandatory in Brazil, Pele, Dr Socrates, Little bird, Dozy, Chipstick, Zico … what on earth is going on? Never mind all this money being slung about while we stare into the abyss, why are these ludicrous monikers being so profligately spilt in the land of the samba? Let Manchester City fund the research into this phenomenon.</p>
<p>I wish that City would stop snooping around West Ham's Scott Parker and Craig Bellamy with their silly money and instead focus on that lovable nitwit Luis Boa Morte, whose transfer to <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/football/hullcity">Hull City</ref> was kiboshed on account of the player's outlandish wage demands. The fee had been agreed, the medical passed and then Boa Morte leapt in with his pie‑in‑the-sky personal terms.</p>
<p>To be honest I'm surprised he got through the medical without tripping over the scales or banging his bonce on the x-ray machine, as at Upton Park he has discovered a realm beyond poor form that borders on the holy. Open goals have been shunned like nonces, sublime balls stepped on like cow pats, in the end it becomes quite soothing as you necessarily relinquish your attachment just to cope.</p>
<p>I see why the Victorians were prone to taking saucy day trips to Bedlam to marvel at the loopy; after the initial pang of humanity I'm sure their antics become a real tonic. I'd like to suggest they take Boa Morte up to Eastlands as light relief, they could have him for what it would cost to pay Kaka's wages for a fortnight and I guarantee he'd lighten the mood up there, skidding around hoofing the ball into wherever chance and geometry haphazardly dictate. If acumen and logic have led us to this, then why not fling the reins of the game into the clammy palms of insanity and see where that takes us?</p>
