<p>David Cameron joked about Silvio Berlusconi’s penchant for “jacuzzis and whores” before heading to Rome for a state dinner with his Italian counterpart, a graffiti artist whose work Cameron chose as a diplomatic gift has revealed.</p>
<p>Ben Eine’s painting Twenty First Century City was presented to Barack Obama in 2010 on Cameron’s first trip to Washington in 2010. Shortly afterward Eine was invited to Downing Street for tea and biscuits with the prime minister and his wife Samantha, just before Cameron was due in Rome for his first meeting with Berlusconi.</p>
<p>Cameron jokingly reassured his wife that he would not be sharing jacuzzis with Berlusconi and prostitutes, Eine told a told a conference in London.</p>
<p>Eine, a self-confessed former graffiti vandal who began his career tagging trains, revealed Cameron’s unguarded remarks during a filmed interview to mark the start of three-day conference on graffiti at London’s South Bank centre.</p>
<p>Eine said Cameron had to leave early to travel to Rome. He said: “We were sitting there chatting away and his PA or assistant came in and said: ‘David, we’ve got to go’. And he jumped up and said ‘Samantha I’ve got to go off to Italy – dinner with Berlusconi. Don’t worry I’ll get so-and-so to pull me out of the jacuzzi before the whores turn up’.</p>
<p>“And then he walked out the door. And I was like, that’s great, prime ministers aren’t meant to say that in front of bods like me, just in case I do this and repeat the story in front of a video camera. I started off tagging stuff – I’m not meant to be having tea and biscuits with the prime minister.”</p>

<p>Eine said he was impressed by Cameron but said he would never vote for him. “I have never voted in my life and I would never vote Tory,” he said. “[But] I really enjoyed talking to him. He was interesting, he was funny. He’s obviously a really smart and on the ball man.”</p>
<p>Cameron <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/aug/04/david-cameron-late-silvio-berluscon">was late </ref>for his first meeting with Berlusconi, which came shortly after a 38-year-old prostitute, Maria Teresa De Nicolo, had described how she and perhaps 15 women enjoyed a meal with Italy’s prime minister before she and a couple of the others joined him in bed.</p>
<p>A No 10 spokesman said Downing Street never comments on private conversations.</p>
<p>In the video, Eine also joked about the possible fate of his painting at the White House since it was presented to the US president. He said: “I’ve never seen the painting after they picked it up. It’s probably in the cupboard of unwanted gifts that they only get out when that foreign dignitary comes backs to visit.”</p>
<p>Eine talked about his surprise when his work was chosen by the British prime minister. “I couldn’t possibly believe that me a graffiti writer with convictions for drugs and graffiti, unemployed and not really working at the time, could be there artist of choice to represent the country.”</p>
<p>He suspects he was the second graffiti artist on Downing Street’s list, behind Banksy. “Banksy said no, or would say no,” he said as he tried to imagine the selection process: “They are sitting there, and it’s like: ‘We should get Banksy to do it,’ and then someone says: ‘No, he’ll never do it’. And then they’re like, who’s second on the list? ‘All right, let us phone up Ben Eine, he might do it’.”</p>
