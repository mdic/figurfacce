<main>
<p>The <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberaldemocrats">Liberal Democrats</ref> held onto the Hampshire seat of Eastleigh in a battle with their coalition partners that left the Conservatives reeling in third place.</p>
<p>The result came after an extremely difficult week for <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nickclegg">Nick Clegg</ref>, as he struggled to get his story straight over what he knew of sexual harassment allegations against his party's former chief executive Lord Rennard.</p>
<p>Ukip took an unprecedented 28% of the vote to come second. Party leader Nigel Farage says that they are no longer simply a protest vote.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Labour candidate John O'Farrell finished a distant fourth - a result that will fuel critics of Ed Miliband's party as one that cannot compete in the south of the country.</p>
<p>Joining Tom Clark to discuss all of this: <hi rend="#b">Jonathan Isaby</hi> of the Taxpayers' Alliance; <hi rend="#b">Prateek Buch</hi> of the Social Liberal Forum; and the Guardian's <hi rend="#b">Michael White</hi>.</p>
<p>Also this week: we look at the Italian election which has so far failed to produce a government. With the mainstream politicians rejected by voters and no leader claiming a ruling majority is the slumbering Euro-crisis about to return with a vengeance? We hear from our Rome correspondent Lizzy Davies.</p>
