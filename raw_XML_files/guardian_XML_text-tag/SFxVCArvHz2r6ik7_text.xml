<p>Silvio Berlusconi faced revolt from all sides, including his political allies, yesterday as Italy's unions rose up against his planned pension reforms, and MPs stalled a bill that would have allowed him to expand his media empire.</p>
<p>The three largest unions have called on their 11 million members to strike in protest at the government's radical pension reforms.</p>
<p>But the prime minister insisted that he would forge on with the plan.</p>
<p>At the same time, MPs narrowly voted to amend a media bill that would have allowed his media empire, already accused of monopolising terrestrial television, to spread into radio and print.</p>
<p>Normally loyal members of the government coalition are thought to have voted to amend the bill, under the cover of a secret ballot.</p>
<p>The unions plan a protest on Saturday, raising the spectre of defeat for Mr Berlusconi whose first government, in 1994, collapsed amid mass protests about pensions.</p>
