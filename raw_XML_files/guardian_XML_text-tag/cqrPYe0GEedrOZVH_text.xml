<p>The Italian prime minister, <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref>, has been put under investigation for allegedly avoiding paying millions of pounds in taxes, the Italian media report, just as his government is pushing through an immunity law to save him from a possible corruption conviction.</p>
<p>His name has been added to a list of others, including David Mills, the British lawyer and husband of the culture minister Tessa Jowell, already under investigation for possible involvement in his company Mediaset's alleged avoidance of about Â£60m in taxes when it bought the rights to American films.</p>
<p>Judges in Milan have asked the US judiciary to help their investigation of the alleged use of offshore companies in the Virgin Islands to buy the film rights and sell them to Mediaset at a vastly inflated price to set against taxes.</p>
<p>Mr Berlusconi is reportedly being investigated for tax fraud and false book-keeping.</p>
<p>His lawyers said they had not been told of the new inquiry, but added that Mr Berlusconi was clear of any implication in the case, since he had distanced himself from management positions in his company by the time of the alleged offences.</p>
