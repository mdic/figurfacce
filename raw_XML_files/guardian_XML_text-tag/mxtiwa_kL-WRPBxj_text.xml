<p>Here are some things I know about Italian politics (don't worry, this won't take long): first, prime ministers last only about three and a half days, which is why the safest thing you can say in any GCSE history essay, apart from "the middle classes were gaining strength", is "Italy was in a state of flux". Second, its politicians generally seem a little more flamboyant than your average, perhaps not in the arena of mistresses, but certainly in the respect of brown envelopes full of wonga. Plus, Silvio is quite an outspoken fella. So you'd expect his governance to feel as if it had lasted longer than it has, simply because, to have gathered this much background knowledge about a German premier, say, he (or she) would have to have been in power for about 20 years.</p>
<p>But still, let's count it up: about seven scandals regarding his hilariously unreconstructed view of the Middle East; a scandal about bribery; one about tax evasion; one about false accounting; and a whopping big one where he tried to change the fabric of the law just to dodge all the other scandals. And this is keeping so strictly to the definition of the word "scandal" that it doesn't mention the crazy quotes about Genoa, the face-lift, the stranglehold over the media and the all-round unpleasantness. Is that not an awful lot to pack in? In four years?</p>
