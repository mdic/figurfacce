<p>If nothing else, <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref> might have expected that the only focus of attention at Thursday night's verdict reading would be him (albeit in absentia).</p>
<p>But even in that he was confounded. Just minutes before the entrance of the five judges who <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/02/silvio-berlusconi-reaction-italy-sentence">handed the former prime minister his first ever definitive conviction</ref>, an overexcited carabiniere in court unleashed some dance moves that kept the waiting journalists entertained and have now made him a star on YouTube.</p>
<p>Apparently unable to contain himself ahead of one of the most important court decisions in Italy's recent history, the officer, clearly feeling the anticipation in the air, performed a couple of quick white-gloved moves to the delight of the press corps. His inspiration appeared to be the Village People's YMCA.</p>
<p>To a group of journalists who had by that point been waiting in the court for more than seven hours, they will have gone down a treat.</p>
