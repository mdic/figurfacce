<p>Veronica Lario, the estranged wife of <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref>, has broken the silence she has kept since asking the Italian prime minister for a divorce, claiming he lied to her about his life and was becoming a "ridiculous figure before the world", thanks to the sex scandal engulfing him.</p>
<p>Lario, 53, is quoted in a new book, <hi rend="#i">Tendenza Veronica</hi>, which reveals the thinking behind her decision to divorce Berlusconi at the end of April, after learning he had attended the 18th birthday party of aspiring actress Noemi Letizia.</p>
<p>Lario, herself a former actress, said at the time she could not be with a man who "frequented minors". In the book she tells author Maria Latella, an Italian journalist who has known Lario for 18 years, that Berlusconi (correctly) informed her that he was going to Naples for a conference on refuse control, but failed to tell her he would also attend Letizia's birthday party, at which he gave her an expensive necklace as a gift.</p>
<p>"In the afternoon he told me, 'You know, I've got to go to this meeting on rubbish. Early tomorrow morning.' It was the latest lie. So it was time for me to find some respect for myself. It was better to divorce. I don't know where this conviction, this force, came from. Anyway, it's him who put me in this position."</p>
<p>Extracts of the book will appear on Wednesday in <hi rend="#i">Corriere della Sera</hi>, just as the stream of revelations about Berlusconi's private parties, some of which were attended by paid escort Patrizia D'Addario, was appearing to dry up.</p>
<p>Latella writes that she cooked lunch for Lario at her Milan apartment shortly after the news of Berlusconi's links to Letizia broke.</p>
<p>"I think I have no other choice than to separate," she quotes Lario telling her. Asked why she had not confronted her husband, Lario said she could not bring herself to do it. "He would tell me yet another lie and this time I would not be able to resist," she said.</p>
<p>"Will they say I could have done this before? Maybe, so therefore this will be a catch-up divorce, let's put it that way. I cannot condemn myself to being his nanny, and I can no longer stop him making himself ridiculous before the world. I am at the end of the line. Ten years ago I was not ready; today I can say with my head high, 'I am separating from this man.'"</p>
<p>She told Latella that Berlusconi was in danger of leaving a shameful legacy. "What makes me most unhappy is that a man like Silvio has betrayed himself. He has done a lot, he has conquered many things, and today the things they say about him make you forget what he truly was."</p>
<p>Lario's divorce announcement was not the first time she has taken aim in public at her husband. In 2007 she wrote to a newspaper criticising him for flirting with a showgirl, drawing a craven apology from Berlusconi. More recently, Lario described his plans to send showgirls to represent Italy at the European Parliament as "shamelessly trashy".</p>
<p>Berlusconi first saw Lario, real name Miriam Raffaella Bartolini, when she was performing topless in a play in 1980. He was still married to Carla Dall'Oglio, with whom he had two children, Piersilvio and Marina. He married Lario in 1990 after she had given him three children, Barbara, Eleonora and Luigi. Latella claims in the book that Barbara Berlusconi had taken her mother's side. When Italian opposition leader Dario Franceschini asked in May, "Would you have your children educated by a man like Berlusconi?" Barbara was reluctant to publicly defend her father, nearly breaking off relations with him during a heated phone call.</p>
<p>Despite traditional Catholic family values, Lario said she felt <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy">Italy</ref> had been hoping her marriage would dissolve. "This is a strange country. Everyone was rooting for the break-up, waiting for the news that even this marriage had ended."</p>
<p>Berlusconi has dismissed the scandal over his relationship with Letizia, claiming he has known her parents for years. Letizia's father said he coined the nickname "Papi" his daughter used for Berlusconi, although numerous women say it was in widespread use by showgirls and models frequenting Berlusconi's homes.</p>
<p>Letizia was back in the headlines this week after being photographed in a bikini on a Sardinian beach a few hundred yards from Berlusconi's Villa Certosa, where she was a guest at party last new year.</p>
<p>This week, Berlusconi told the gossip magazine <hi rend="#i">Chi</hi>, which he owns, that he had never "knowlingly invited to my house people who are less than serious". His dinners, he added, were "irreproachable for their morality and elegance".</p>
