<p>The private life of Italy's prime minister, <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref>, came under scrutiny yesterday - from his wife. A biography of the former actress, Veronica Lario, reveals that the image she has of him, after 25 years of marriage, is of a man constantly on the telephone, even at Christmas.</p>
<p>"In my mind's eye, Silvio always has a telephone pressed to his ear," her biographer, the Corriere della Sera journalist Maria Latella, quotes her as saying.</p>
<p>"Silvio lunches with the telephone within reach. Even at Christmas, he talks to us, tastes the turkey, but is meanwhile responding to those who are ringing up. That's the way he is."</p>
<p>And in public, says the retiring Mrs Berlusconi, he guides her every move. "If we are out together, he says: 'Wave', 'Smile', 'Stick out your hand'."</p>
<p>Her reluctance to attend official banquets and the like has prompted rumours of strains in the Berlusconi marriage. But she says she is happy to play a rarely seen supporting role.</p>
