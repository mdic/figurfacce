<p>Italy's prime minister, <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref>, made a swift and humiliating U-turn after it was found that a clause inserted into an emergency budget would have allowed him to suspend a compensation payment worth hundreds of millions of euros to a business rival.</p>
<p>Berlusconi said: "I have given orders for this right and proper measure to be withdrawn to clear the field of any controversy."</p>
<p>There were reports it had not been discussed in cabinet and that neither Berlusconi's finance minister, Giulio Tremonti, nor his allies in the Northern League had been aware of it. The foreign minister, Franco Frattini, acknowledged "there was no in-depth discussion of this measure in cabinet".</p>
<p>The legislation in question was an emergency budget, drawn up to stabilise Italy's public finances and prevent the eurozone's most heavily indebted state from going the same way as Greece. A press conference to present the budget was cancelled on grounds that Tremonti could not return to Rome because of bad weather.</p>
<p>The clause, buried in more than 100 pages, was discovered weeks before judges were due to decide on a compensation case involving Berlusconi's Fininvest media group. Berlusconi withdrew the clause, accusing critics of "disgraceful exaggeration". Legal experts voiced astonishment at the "ruse".</p>
