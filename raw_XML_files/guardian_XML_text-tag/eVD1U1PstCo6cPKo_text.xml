<p>It wasn't exactly a sign from heaven, but impressive all the same.</p>
<p>Holidaymakers enjoying the sun on Italy's Adriatic riviera were astonished to see a light aircraft trailing a banner with the message: "Don't come back, Silvio. Thank you." The request was aired as Italy's former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi continued to dither over whether to <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/24/berlusconi-plans-comeback?INTCMP=SRCH">lead the People of Freedom party he founded into the next general election</ref>.</p>
<p>The plane and its message, which <ref target="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwYo5vKnkTM">drew applause from at least one beach</ref>, was a response to a similar gesture the week before by one of the TV mogul's senators. Mario Mantovani hired a plane to <ref target="http://www.repubblica.it/cronaca/2012/08/25/foto/silvio_la_sfida_nel_cielo_torna_non_tornare_-41464301/1/">fly a banner over the ranks of sunbathers</ref> reading: "Come back Silvio."</p>
<p>The reply was the work of an IT consultant from Rimini, 30-year-old Gianluca Zamagni, who arranged it with the help of others brought together on Facebook. Their initiative echoed what polls show is a widespread desire among young Italians in particular for a clean sweep of the mainly elderly leaders who have presided over more than a decade of economic stagnation.</p>
<p>"I would have done it for other politicians too," Zamagni said.</p>
