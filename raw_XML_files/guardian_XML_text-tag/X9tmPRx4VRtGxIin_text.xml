<p>Up to 100 newspaper titles in <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy">Italy</ref> are facing closure because of the government's subsidy cuts - down from €170m a year to €53m (£142/£44m).</p>
<p>The include Liberazione, a communist daily; L'Unita, the paper founded by Antonio Gramsci; Il Manifesto, an independent left-wing paper; and Avvenire, a popular Catholic daily. But the bulk of the closures will involve local papers across the country.</p>
<p>According to <ref target="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3fc6beea-3303-11e1-8e0d-00144feabdc0.html">the Financial Times's report,</ref> The subsidies are now viewed as a wasteful abuse of taxpayers' money to prop up a declining industry with limited readership (Liberazione publishes about 5,000 copies).</p>
<p>The cuts, ordered by the previous government of <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref>, have been confirmed by Mario Monti's administration.</p>
<p>Mainstream newspapers – such as Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica – will continue to benefit from indirect subsidies, such as VAT waivers on copies sold by subscription and reduced postal delivery costs.</p>
