<hi>"With respect and discretion I have faced up to the inevitable conflicts and painful moments that a long matrimonial relationship brings with it.</hi>
<hi>"I am now writing to express my reaction to the statements made by my husband during the gala dinner that followed the award of the Telegatti [TV prizes] in which addressing certain of the ladies present he allowed himself to [make] remarks that are unacceptable to me: 'If I weren't married already I'd marry you in a trice', 'I'd go anywhere with you' ...</hi>

<p>With these words - published in a <ref target="http://www.repubblica.it/2007/01/sezioni/politica/lettera-veronica/lettera-veronica/lettera-veronica.html">national newspaper</ref> - Veronica Lario, wife of former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, denounced her husband's flirtatious behaviour and demanded an apology.</p>
<p>She <ref target="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/31/AR2007013100374.html">says</ref> she decided to ask for a public apology "not having received one privately".</p>
<p>So, was she right to do it? Would <hi rend="#i">you</hi> complain about your partner's indiscretions to a newspaper? Would you write a more venomous letter than Veronica's? Or would you find some other way to take your revenge?</p>
