<p>The Italian prime minister, <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref>, was yesterday trying to prevent another ally from leaving his crumbling coalition government and facing a vote of confidence in parliament.</p>
<p>The foreign minister, Gianfranco Fini, leader of the National Alliance (AN), said his party would decide whether to leave the cabinet after the 69-year-old premier addressed the senate later today.</p>
<p>The AN would be the second party to leave Mr Berlusconi's four-party centre-right coalition, and its exit would bring the government down one year ahead of schedule, forcing snap elections.</p>
<p>Even if the party continues to support Mr Berlusconi, he would still have to resign in the event of losing tomorrow's vote of confidence.</p>
<p>Mr Berlusconi has been struggling to find a way out of a political crisis which started when his coalition suffering a crushing defeat in regional elections this month. Another ally, the Union of Christian Democrats, pulled out of the coalition after Mr Berlusconi refused to agree to a big cabinet reshuffle and a change in policies.</p>
<p>Both the UDC and the AN believed they had secured a promise from Mr Berlusconi to resign temporarily on Monday - a formal move required under the Italian constitution - to form a new cabinet with a fresh platform.</p>
<p>But instead of handing in his resignation to President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Mr Berlusconi told the head of state he would stay and face a test of his authority.</p>
<p>His decision angered his allies, in particular Mr Fini who had stated that the premier would resign and who believes that the coalition's policies are skewed in favour of the country's more prosperous north, represented in the coalition by the Northern League.</p>
<p>Mr Fini said: "The National Alliance does not agree with the decision the prime minister took yesterday ... Berlusconi has reinforced the already widespread negative impressions that the league is the boss of the coalition." He called on Mr Berlusconi to show that the government has the interests of Italy's poorest families, many of whom live in the south, at heart. But he added that for now he would continue to support Mr Berlusconi in parliament.</p>
<p>Mr Berlusconi will have to call on all his legendary charisma when he puts his case in speeches to the senate and then in the lower house of parliament, the Chamber of Deputies, later today.</p>
<p>Italian politics, never clear at the best of times, is now in a state of suspense. Both the UDC and the AN will have to continue to back Mr Berlusconi or agree to vote him out of office, risking elections as early as June.</p>
<p>Polls indicate that the centre-left, led by former European commission president Romano Prodi, would win.</p>
<p>Mr Berlusconi's government - the 59th since 1949 - is the longest serving in modern times. Its five-year term is not due to end until 2006.</p>
