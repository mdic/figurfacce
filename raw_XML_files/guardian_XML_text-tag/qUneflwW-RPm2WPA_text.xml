<p>The praise for Barack Obama came from all over the world yesterday, but two well-wishers stood out: Italy's prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and Iran's president <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/mahmoud-ahmadinejad">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</ref>.</p>
<p>"I hope you will prefer real public interests and justice to the never-ending demands of a selfish minority, and seize the opportunity to serve people so that you will be remembered with high esteem," Ahmadinejad said, according to the English website of Irna, the official Iranian news agency.</p>
<p>Berlusconi, meanwhile, said the first African-American elected president is "young, handsome and even tanned". Speaking at a Moscow news conference, Berlusconi appeared to be joking, according to the AP.</p>
<p>But Italian news agencies said later that Berlusconi defended the remark, calling it a compliment and an endearment. Italian centre-left opposition leader Walter Veltroni said the words "wound Italy's dignity".</p>
