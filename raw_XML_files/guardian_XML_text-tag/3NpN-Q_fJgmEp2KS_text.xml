<p><hi rend="#b">Silvio Berlusconi</hi>'s media empire has taken a surprising new direction with the launch of its latest magazine. Best known for celebrity titles full of paparazzi pictures, Il Mio Papa – My Pope in Italian – will be devoted entirely to Pope Francis. Scheduled for a print run of 3m for the launch issue, the target circulation is said to be 500,000. The Times reports that those devoted half a million readers will be treated to regular features like Saint of the Week, in-depth articles such as how the Pope missed a Rome seminary because he had a touch of flu and interviews with pilgrims in St Peter's Square.</p>
