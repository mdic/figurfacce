<hi rend="#b">Margaret Thatcher</hi>
</head>
<p><ref target="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ-M0KEFm9I">“You turn if you want to. The lady’s not for turning.”</ref><lb/> I literally just turned around. Nothing happened. Big whoop. <hi rend="#b">1/10</hi></p>
<head rend="h2">
<hi rend="#b">David Cameron</hi>
</head>
<p><ref target="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/9000253/David-Cameron-interview-those-who-work-hard-will-be-rewarded.html">“I watched, for the 17th and hopefully the last time, The Guns of Navarone on New Year’s Eve. I always watch just in case the explosives don’t go off in the end.”</ref><lb/> We get it Dave, you like explosions. Calm down. <hi rend="#b">1/10</hi></p>
<head rend="h2">
<hi rend="#b">Ed Miliband</hi>
</head>
<p><ref target="https://vine.co/v/O3jalxOZuLK">“Am I tough enough? Hell, yes, I’m tough enough.”</ref><lb/> An especially poor effort, especially given that Miliband said it in the voice of the kid from that <ref target="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvbSlqnlyp8&amp;feature=youtu.be">McCain oven chips advert</ref>. <hi rend="#b">2/10</hi></p>
<head rend="h2">
<hi rend="#b">David Steel</hi>
</head>
<p><ref target="http://www.totalpolitics.com/speeches/liberal/liberal-democrat-conference-leaders-speeches/34763/speech-to-the-liberal-assembly-1981-go-back-to-your-constituencies.thtml">“Go back to your constituencies, and prepare for government!”</ref><lb/> Apparently some of his audience are still at home preparing for government, like those Japanese soldiers who didn’t know the war ended. <hi rend="#b">2/10</hi></p>
<head rend="h2">
<hi rend="#b">Boris Johnson</hi>
</head>
<p><ref target="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/4263811/No-one-obeys-the-speed-limit-except-a-motorised-rickshaw.html">“No one obeys the speed limit except a motorised rickshaw.” </ref><lb/> In an ideal world, Boris would have left a pause after “limit”, put on his aviators, finished the quote and then sped off on his motorbike to the strains of Bad to the Bone, leaving a befuddled policeman in his wake. But still, points for trying. <hi rend="#b">6/10</hi></p>
<head rend="h2">
<hi rend="#b">Ronald Reagan</hi>
</head>
<p><ref target="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NefcAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA698&amp;lpg=PA698&amp;dq=congress+feel+the+heat+reagan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bbYXCqJYqo&amp;sig=n5KnqsTVoIbBY-X9KEBbdpG4Tjk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiL6peEpqfKAhWBdA8KHV5qDFkQ6AEIKTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=congress%20feel%20the%20heat%20reagan&amp;f=false">“When you can’t make them see the light, make them feel the heat.”</ref><lb/> Like Boris, this quote needed an ellipsis, a flip-down welder’s mask and a blowtorch for it to really pop. <hi rend="#b">6/10</hi></p>
<head rend="h2">
<hi rend="#b">George W Bush</hi>
</head>
<p><ref target="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB145D3XJzE">“Every nation in every region now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.”</ref><lb/> It’s the “in every region” that seals this one. Scandinavia, Bush is looking right at you. <hi rend="#b">7/10</hi></p>
<head rend="h2">
<hi rend="#b">Hillary Clinton</hi>
</head>
<p><ref target="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2012/10/18/hillary-clinton-cant-stand-whining/">“I can’t stand whining.”</ref><lb/> This is Clinton as Alan Sugar at the start of The Apprentice, and therefore more terrifying than she’s ever been. <hi rend="#b">7/10</hi></p>
<head rend="h2">
<hi rend="#b">Winston Churchill</hi>
</head>
<p><ref target="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkTw3_PmKtc">“We shall fight on the beaches.”</ref><lb/> Have you ever tried to fight someone on a beach? All that sand means you can’t really get enough purchase. Churchill really meant business here. <hi rend="#b">8/10</hi></p>
<head rend="h2">
<hi rend="#b">Vladimir Putin</hi>
</head>
<p><ref target="http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/putin-says-moscow-will-not-negotiate/233052.html">“Russia doesn’t negotiate with terrorists. It destroys them.” </ref><lb/> This is how you do it. Chilling. <hi rend="#b">9/10</hi></p>
<head rend="h2">
<hi rend="#b">Silvio Berlusconi</hi>
</head>
<p><ref target="http://gawker.com/5787535/berlusconi-thinks-30-of-italian-women-want-his-body">“When asked if they would like to have sex with me, 30% of women said ‘yes’, while the other 70% replied: ‘What, again?’”</ref><lb/> Legitimately, the scariest words ever spoken by a politician. Obama, you never stood a chance. <hi rend="#b">10/10</hi></p>
