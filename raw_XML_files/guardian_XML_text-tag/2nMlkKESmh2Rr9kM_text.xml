<p>A verdict is expected today on whether David Mills, the estranged husband of the Olympics minister, Tessa Jowell, took a bribe from the Italian prime minister, <ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/world/silvio-berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</ref>, to give false evidence in corruption trials.</p>
<p>Judges have begun the deliberations that bring to an end a three-year trial in which Mills, 64, faced charges of accepting a $600,000 (then Â£350,000) payment from the politician and tycoon.</p>
<p>Prosecutors are asking for a sentence of four years and eight months if he is convicted.</p>
<p>Berlusconi was originally accused of corruption, until his government passed a law giving him legal immunity.</p>
<p>Mills, a tax lawyer, is accused of taking the alleged bribe to give false testimony in a trial Berlusconi faced in relation to his business dealings. Mills was one of Berlusconi's consultants on offshore tax havens.</p>
<p>The charges stemmed from a letter which Mills sent to a British accountant in 2004 in which he said the $600,000 payment came from "Mr B".</p>
<p>He wrote: "I turned some very tricky corners, to put it mildly, and so kept Mr B out of a great deal of trouble that I would have landed him in had I said all I knew."</p>
<p>Mills has said the letter described a hypothetical situation as a way of soliciting tax advice for an unnamed client.</p>
<p>He has said the money came from an Italian businessman, Diego Attanasio, who had once been his client, a claim repeated by Berlusconi, but one which Attanasio denies.</p>
<p>Neither Mills nor Berlusconi was present for any of the hearings. Both deny any wrongdoing.</p>
