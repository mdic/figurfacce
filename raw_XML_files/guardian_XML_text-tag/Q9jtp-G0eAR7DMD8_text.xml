<p>I hope your prediction is right that Silvio Berlusconi's decision to seek a new term as Italy's prime minister "is almost certainly beyond his grasp" (<ref target="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/10/italy-mummys-return-silvio-berlusconi-editorial">Editorial</ref>, 11 December). Just a couple of cautionary comments. Italy's newspaper readership is low. One study revealed that 82% of Italians depend only on television for news â€“ the highest percentage in the European Union. Berlusconi's media dominance does include newspapers (Il Giornale) and Mondadori, Italy's largest book and magazine publishing group. However, it is control of three commercial television channels which will enable him to shamelessly promote his political ambitions.</p>
<p>We should also remember that his years as Italy's prime minister allowed Berlusconi to neuter critical voices and programmes on RAI, the public service broadcaster. Mario Monti's brief spell as prime minister could not address this particular democratic deficit.<hi rend="#b">Granville Williams</hi><hi rend="#i">Pontefract, West Yorkshire</hi></p>
